0,Post,hm525p,Announcement: only medical students will be verified as students,murpahurp,Physician | Moderator | Top Contributor,1594030661.0,"Dear users,

Recently there have been nursing schools that have switched to online teaching due to covid. Some of their assignments now include giving advice on askdocs as flaired users. This has lead to the mod team getting swamped by these request, and the newly flaired users hardly post. (And we’re not impressed by the advice given by students)

After an internal discussion we have now decided to stop flairing all student except medical students. The sub is called askdocs, and we want our flair system to reflect the quality of the advice. Otherwise the advice of a senior medical student will seem equal to for example a nursing or paramedic student. 

Unflaired users are of course still welcome to post their advice (even if they have to for a school assignment), as long as it is appropriate. They are just not allowed to claim medical credentials as per our existing rules.

Regards,
The mod team.",2779,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/hm525p/announcement_only_medical_students_will_be/

From old post:

 Age: 31, Weight: 188

I do not smoke.

Drinking: Yes. Occasional not heavy.

Medical history: GERD & LPR. Measures have been taken (such as elevated sleeping, not eating late) to manage.

Problem: (In short) swallowing problems, chronic infection

Duration: Now about two years

Medication: Pantoprazole 40mg daily, Flonase once daily.

Hey everyone,

After nearly two years of searching, 40+ rounds of antibiotics, CT scans, MRI's, ultrasounds, and many, many doctors a sinus specialist discovered a 5mm oromaxillary fistula hidden under tooth extraction site #2 (molar, top right rear). This basically is a hole the size of a pencil eraser head from my mouth into my sinus. This was causing severe infections, swallowing problems and a sensation I can only describe as horrifying. 

&#x200B;

I underwent oral surgery and recovery is very slow, but ongoing. 

&#x200B;

I'm not sure if posting a solved story is appropriate here, but I was told this was a very rare scenario and perhaps it could help someone in the community. 

&#x200B;

Cheers.

31M.  5'8"";  125LB;  Caucasian;  trouble breathing/abdominal pressure;  7 year duration;  condition undiagnosed - separate diagnosis of reactive hypoglycemia;  current medication (Acarbose 50mg every meal);  ZERO drugs/drinking/smoking/vaping/caffeine;

My name is Jason Otto.  I've been so sick for so long I don't care about online anonymity anymore.  Here's a pic of me to prove I'm not making this up:  
[https://ibb.co/1vHzn3x](https://ibb.co/1vHzn3x)

I am extremely messed up.  I have been unable to work for the last 8 years and savings have nearly run out.  I am now homeless (living out of my car).  I have traveled the United States in search of help and I am currently at Harvard.  I thought I would get help here but it's more of the same: condescending doctors who take very little time to even talk to the patient and figure out what's wrong.  I don't know where else to turn.

I am currently looking for a doctor that gives a shit about his/her patients.  ***I'm looking with someone with integrity.***  I am willing to travel anywhere in the country and can be there within 24 hours.  Most dismiss me after the usual 20 minute appointment and tell me nothing else can be done.  There is no brainstorming, no critical thinking, no followup, nothing.  I don't think that these people understand how serious this situation is.  I cannot work, I can barely get out of bed (now my car-seat) in the morning, my cognition is in the toilet and I am unable to function in daily life.  I am a vegetable.

My problems began in April 2013.  I had been having gastritis for a good 6 months and was treated unsuccessfully by several GI docs and their PPIs and H2 blockers.  Out of desperation, I went to a chiropractor at the recommendation of a friend.  He said he sees all sorts of weird stuff and he will ACTUALLY LISTEN TO YOU.  Sold.

I see this guy and he thinks my gastritis is due to a hiatal hernia.  I now know that this can be seen on an xray and that he was completely full of shit, but I was desperate so just told him to ""fix me please"".  Desperation breeds bad decision making, and without family support I didn't think twice about it.

He said he could manipulate it back into place and laid me down on the table, stuck his fingers in exceptionally hard, deep into my abdomen, just under my ribs, about an inch below my xiphoid process, and pushed in and pulled down toward my naval very forcefully.

***I feel like he moved something out of place.***

Since then I have had trouble breathing, eating, and feel like I'm constantly being hit in the stomach.  I feel like the life is being sucked out of me.  It's hard for me to move, it's hard for me to think, refreshing sleep is next to impossible, and I feel like I'm stuck in overdrive all the time because I am so uncomfortable that I cannot calm down.  Something feels out of place in my abdomen, almost like it was shifted downward, and no one can seem to tell me what it is or how to treat it.

I've had CTs, MRIs, xrays, and many other tests.  GI has been ruled out with extensive testing (EGD, barium swallow studies, gastric emptying scans, etc.)  It feels like it is outside of my GI tract, ***almost as if my liver has been displaced.***  When you go to a doctor and say you are having problems in the epigastric area, you are referred to a GI.  GI has been ruled out, and there is nothing wrong.  It feels like it's some sort of organ or something else that has been forcefully moved.  I feel like I'm in hell in my own body.

I struggle to focus because I feel the need to constantly lay down.  It's like being hit in the stomach and needing to sit there for a moment to just relax and catch your breath, but the feeling is constant and never goes away.  This has crippled me and I cannot do simple things like reading books.

If anyone has any idea on what this could be, or has any recommendation on where to go or who to see, PLEASE let me know.  I'm someone who always repays the favor, and if you can point me in the right direction or help me in any way, I will more than make it up to you.

I used to be a somebody, and now I'm rotting away in my vehicle.  I've lost 40 pounds because the thought of food makes me sick, and I cannot find relief.

Thank you.

\-M

**Also, THERE IS NO PAIN.**  I need to make that clear.  It's pressure/tension that is constant and I do not feel pain with this at all.

I also feel a **beating heartbeat in the area**, like my heart is pushing against it.  The heartbeat is pronounced.

Here is a link to an image I uploaded showing the area (under xiphoid process, near liver and diaphragm):  [https://ibb.co/ByrJ4xS](https://ibb.co/ByrJ4xS)

10,Comment,e3nrbd,Need help - Harvard gave up - homeless,Unknown,,2019-11-30 01:33:29,"Does eating make the pain any worse/better? Are you avoiding eating because it worsens your symptoms or have you lost appetite entirely? Do you have any difficulty swallowing?

Does anything in particular (movement, etc.) make the pain worse? Do over the counter analgaesics (paracetamol, NSAIDs, etc.) help at all?

Given when/how it came on, I would be most concerned about mechanical trauma to the diaphragm, esophagus or LES. Displacement of the liver is unlikely given how firmly anchored it is.

Just to clarify, did you have all of this battery of testing **after** the chiropractor? I would also consider esophageal manometry assuming you haven't had it already.

Were esophageal biopsies taken during the EGD? I would also be quite suspicious of eosinophilic esophagitis given your description.",215,0,

No medications

No drug or alcohol use

I‘ve had anorexia nervosa since I was a child, but this is the lowest my weight has ever been. Lately, I’ve been unable to keep down any food or water; I get extreme abdominal pain and bloating and I throw it up involuntarily. For the past day now, my mouth and throat has been so dry that I can’t swallow anything. I’ve been losing my hair too, clumps at a time every time I shower. I also keep getting random muscle twitches in my arms and legs.

I live alone at my college dormitory. No health insurance. I don’t have much of a support system, as my parents have ignored my eating disorder my entire life and I’ve gone no-contact with them.

I’m so, so scared. I feel like I’m dying. I don’t want to go to the emergency room because I can’t afford it and I’m worried they‘ll tell me I have no reason to be there. Every time I’ve had bloodwork done in the past, it has always come back normal, so what if the doctors think I’m making up my eating disorder? 

I know my weight is technically low, but I feel like it doesn’t look like it’s that low. I don’t want to take up resources when hospitals are already overcome with all the COVID cases. Would the emergency room be able to do anything anyway? What are my options with no insurance? 

How can I increase my caloric intake without throwing it all up?

EDIT: I went to the local children’s hospital ER, upon everyone’s recommendation. Thank you for all your responses and support! It made me cry. I don’t know if I would have gone if it wasn’t for everyone’s urging. 

I’m still really scared. Apparently I’m in acute kidney failure, and I’m worried it’s irreversible. I really don’t want to die. It’s hard being alone at the hospital in this condition, but the doctors and nurses have been really nice, which is a huge relief. 

I’m being prepped for tube feeding soon, which is terrifying, but I know it’s the only way I’ll get stabilized. I wish it was easier—everything is so painful right now. I have no idea how long I’ll need to stay in the hospital, which makes me more anxious. But, I know deep down that coming here was the right decision.

No doctor would ignore that or think you’re lying. So please don’t hesitate to address your concerns to the ER doc. I can assure you, they’ve dealt with this before and your concerns are very much valid. 

You can talk to a social worker for ways to help with price.

&#x200B;

May 2019, my wife (27) woke up to use the bathroom. When she had finished using the bathroom, her stool was mainly blood and some type of white fatty tissue. This was very random and she had no prior history of poor bowel movements. (picture [https://imgur.com/lv8g9pk](https://imgur.com/lv8g9pk))

) She wanted to go to the emergency room. I thought she was over-reacting, so I dropped her off at the ER since she seemed fine and wasn't in any pain but wanted to get it checked out, and I went to work.

Fast forward about 90 minutes, and I'm getting a phone call from the medical staff that shes going in for surgery and that they already started drugging her up for surgery so she could not sign her own paperwork and that they needed me to come in.

I rushed to the ER in a panic. She had about 10 interns around her super excited to get into surgery, at the time I thought it was odd to be excited to crack open a 27 year old woman. I was informed that during her CT scan that there was a mass found and that they needed to make a 3 inch incision and take a biopsy of the mass, and that the surgery should only take about an hour. I agreed to the surgery and signed the paperwork.

3.5 hours later, my wife comes out of surgery. They had informed me that there ""was no mass"" and believed it to be Intussusception (where your intestines slide into each-other, wont allow food to pass.) They decided to make another 8-inch incision vertically up her abdomen and pull out her intestines to undo the intussusception. Their findings were that there was no intussusception, and that if there was her body had fixed itself.

the medical documents on these findings read ""patient self-corrected"".

the entire past 14 months have been my wife in agonizing pain, all things that were non-existent prior to her double surgery. She can barely keep food down, she throws up anywhere from 3-8 times a day, sometimes just bile because she cant keep food down. She constantly burps, and not tiny i-just-ate belches.. Enormous gut wrenching ""worst heartburn of your life"" releases of air, this happens all day, everyday, from the time she wakes up, until she goes to sleep. The belching is always consistent and gets worse after attempting to eat. She also suffers from severe abdomen bloating anytime she eats anything, no matter how small, no matter how ""healthy"", and also suffers from unruling consistent nausea.

my wife had NOTHING wrong with her prior to that day, she was your healthy average 27 year old girl.

We contacted a lawyer and to save you all the trouble of reading ill sum it up.. They cannot pursue a case, they agree, and the medical experts that reviewed her case say that the medical staff DID JUMP THE GUN on the surgery, but that isn't enough evidence to hold up in court because medical opinions vary.

We've seen the best Gastro doctor in our city, and he sent us a letter telling us not to come back because he exhausted his testing, and cannot assist us further. The doctor we saw performed an Endoscopy, Laroscopy, Colonoscopy, and a Capsule endoscopy and also agreed that the staff jumped the gun on her surgery and to get a lawyer, but that he could no longer help as all her tests came back fine.

So here we are, over a year later, with an enormous medical bill that eats a large percent of our income every single month (thanks insurance!). We lost our residence because my wife couldn't work after her surgery, causing us to lose our home..My wife STILL not knowing whats wrong with her, my wife being in overwhelming daily pain, and myself just having to sit by and watch her get worse and worse by the week. Her hair is falling out, and she is losing weight consistently.

I am a veteran from the US Army, and with the way things are going I'm going to have to drop out of college (my entire reason for joining the military) to go to work full time, as she cannot even work some days due to how nauseas she is on a regular basis. We are overwhelmed and I just want my wife to be healthy again, I'll stand by her forever, but its hard not being able to do anything we used to together. Some days we cant even leave the house together because she is in so much pain.

We think it was the surgery, but I'm not a doctor, and the lawyer says we don't currently have enough evidence to prove that. I feel helpless just watching her every single day, only being able to do things like rub her back and tell her its going to be ok and that we will make it through this.

I will be more than willing to answer any further question and provide information, after 14 months of exhausting resources, I figured you, the good redditors of the internet, might be able to help.

Thank you so much for your time and for reading her story.

TLDR: Wife went to the ER over bloody stool, they said she had a mass, they performed surgery. No mass, they performed an additional surgery I didn't agree to or know about, that proved inconclusive as well. Now my wife suffers from adverse effects every single day.

EDIT: Thank you all for the feedback so far! There's a massive influx of replies and I want to get all my information as accurate as possible when replying to you. My wifes currently asleep and I will reply to everyone i can :)

EDIT 2: Again, thank you all for the feedback, and support. There are so many comments right now its becoming increasingly difficult to keep up with all of them. We have made a checklist of what we think are the best courses of action to explore from these posts. As we continue testing I will continue to update this thread, thank you! (will still attempt to reply to people!)

EDIT 3:-My wife would like me to disclose that she does have extreme anxiety, and that before her trip to the hospital there was some extreme misfortune from her Family. Her father, 60 years old died in his sleep, they were very close. Two weeks later, Her Grandfather (Fathers Father) died, and then 4 weeks later, her Aunt (Sister of her father) Committed suicide. She was dealing with a lot of emotional trauma and shortly after the string of deaths, ended up in the ER herself.

EDIT 4: Thanks for the Hugz award, strangers!

\-The primary feeling of ""air trapped"" she says comes from her Diaphragm.-Nausea can be triggered by Heat, Motion Sickness, Not eating, Eating, constant belching.-She takes an acid reducer every morning, somedays it works, some days it doesn't.

Here's everything we think that was suggested is worth investigating. Please leave replies on this comment for physicians or medical students. (if we missed something through the influx of comments/ DMs please let me know.)

\-Gastric Emptying Scan

\-Xray of Abdomen (not CT scan)

\-MALS (Median Arcuate ligament syndrome)

\- Gastroparesis

\-Mayo Clinic

\-Motility Expert

\-NYP hospital (over 8,000 doctors)

EDIT 5: 11/28/2020 I just need to thank everyone for what they have suggested and done for us, while my wife still deals with medical abnormality pain, we've been able to alleviate it, and shes been looking much healthier the past couple of months. Personal shout out to u/DiamondFeline, your words reached far and my wife has taken great care in her mental health, and her positive attitude has definitely helped swing how she feels/acts.

She is going in for an Ultrasound in 7 days, the Gastro doctor we are seeing thinks that the scar tissue from the surgery bonded to her intestines and that is what is causing her intense amount of abdominal pain/discomfort. We will follow up when we have an answer, If this is the case, it will have been a result of the surgery she got and did not need and we may be able to move forward with a legal case. First thing is making sure my wife Is alright though.

EDIT 6: If anyone is still following, my wife and I still don't know what's wrong with her, things have been better and some doctors have been running miscellaneous tests, but its the same as before, no one really cares, test here, test there, all inconclusive.  I'm posting because its 4:32 in the morning, my wife and I tried to go out for the first time since her surgery and it abruptly ended with stomach pain, throwing up, nausea, every symptom in succession.

Today is the 13th anniversary of my husband’s death in a motorcycle accident. He (M49) was healthy, almost no medical issues and all of his organs were donated. The reason for his accident haunts me to this day. I was so distraught when it happened I didn’t ask all the right questions. 

He was riding on the highway when he got off an exit and just drove off the road, no brakes, no skid marks. He was wearing a full helmet. He was not speeding or otherwise driving erratically. 

EMS found him unresponsive, was resuscitated and then was intubated and on life support in the ICU. He never regained consciousness and was declared brain dead. They said he suffered an atlanto-occipital dislocation which is listed as his cause of death. He also had a subarachnoid hemorrhage and a subdural hematoma where he hit his head above his left eye. He also had a broken wrist but few other injuries. 

His bike was hardly damaged. 

Why did he go off the road? Did he have an aneurysm? Or did the hemorrhage happen during the crash? 

Was it a motorcycle accident or a medical episode?  Will I ever know? His children would like to know for their own health history.  My heart is so unsettled even now. It haunts me everyday not to know what caused my husband’s death so young. 

It’s probably impossible to know but if any physician could hazard a guess it might give me peace.",1149,203,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/164cf4f/my_husbands_m49_death_in_a_motorcycle_accident/

I know you said all of his organs were donated and I wanted to thank you for that incredible gift.   You literally changed the lives of so many with the decision in a time of tremendous grief, and I’m humbled by your choice.   

To the issue at hand, I have to ask: did they do an autopsy after his donation—specifically his brain?  It would be unusual but sometimes coroners will request it in times of uncertainty around a death.   

Without it, a ruptured brain aneurysm as the etiology cannot be ruled out, at least based on the info you provided.   Sometimes, we can look at imaging and just know based on where the subarachnoid blood is located whether or not an aneurysm is even likely.  Purely traumatic subarachnoid blood often has a very different distribution than that of a ruptured aneurysm.   Your husband was in the right age group for one but without some version of an angiogram before death or an autopsy afterward, no one can say for certain.

Help!,CampaignSuitable9205,Layperson/not verified as healthcare professional,1705085671.0,"I’m freaking out. 😭 I’m scared that I either have some crazy form of cancer or was raped or that I’m crazy and had sex that I don’t remember. 

I am 23F and a lesbian, not very sexually active but have sex with the girl I’m sort of seeing about twice a month. She is a cisgender woman and there’s no possible way she could get me pregnant, just to be clear.

The last time I had sex with a male that I remember was in high school six years ago. I am 5’3” 140 lbs. I’m healthy I think, I take Zoloft and sometimes use non prescription allergy medicine but I don’t think those things are relevant.

I started throwing up occasionally maybe a month ago and I wasn’t really worried about it and thought I just had a stomach bug. I went to a walk-in clinic this morning because it wasn’t getting better, and they told me I’m pregnant. I explained that I can’t be pregnant and they said I must be. I don’t really keep track of my periods but I’m not sure if I’ve had one in a couple of months. I am scheduled to see a gynecologist next Friday to confirm the pregnancy but I’m scared and want answers now. 

I’ve been reading that there are some kinds of cancer that can cause a positive pregnancy test but I can’t find a lot of information about them. Can anyone tell me how likely that is??

The only other possibility is last November I had been drinking at my friends’ house where a bunch of us got together to watch a football game, and I don’t drink and drive so I slept on their couch. I didn’t drink all that much, I think 3 drinks, so I shouldn’t have blacked out. My friends whose house I stayed at are a male-female couple. I texted my male friend asking him if we had sex or something and if I was just so drunk I didn’t remember it and he was very confused and upset and said he wouldn’t cheat on his wife or have sex with someone who was that drunk. 

I want to trust my friend but the thing I’m really scared of is that my friend raped me and is lying and that I didn’t even know it. 

I live in Tennessee and abortion is illegal here and I’m scared. Can somebody please tell me what is going on and if there’s any other reason I could have a positive test?

Any existing relevant medical issues recent possible tonsillitis

Current medications anti biotics

Forgive brevity this is raw.

He thought he had tonsillitis just after xmas.

Very painful, in bed exhausted. Very inflamed tonsils. Online local doc diagnosed tonsillitis via web cam.

Several days no food or water. Vomiting regularly. Anti biotics.

Started to feel well last Sunday 3rd and out of bed. Getting back to normal but out of breath with very little exercise.

Was booked covid test but refused as couldn't get swab near mouth and vomiting at the thought.

Got better. Finished anti biotics.

Monday 11th went to work feeling much better. Told workmate felt like someone was standing on his chest. Hard to breathe.

Tuesday yesterday texted work colleague to say he couldn't breathe.

Didn't tell his partner or me. Told her he had throat pain not breathing problem. She said he didn't seem out of breath.

Died in bed this morning between 7am and 12 midday.

Now I'm typing this, i really think we missed covid? He didn't tell anyone about breathing difficulty until Monday but no one saw him in trouble, or just assumed it was related to tonsillitis. 

There will be a post mortem. It's sudden death of 44 year old. 

But any thoughts appreciated.

Edit: amazing replies, love to all thank you. Had coroner on phone. Inconclusive but no obvious damage to heart. Heart has been removed and sent to pathologist and I've given her all the info i have including chest pain and breathing difficulty info. Four people have independently told me that he was complaining from Saturday and Sunday onwards but crucially never told any one person everything.

Unequivocally yes. You set a boundary that was violated and it was violated intentionally despite causing you immense pain and resulting in you crying. Your first goal at this point is to ensure your own safety. Get away and ensure you are safe. 

You may have trauma to your anus due to this. It is hard to say without an examination. It may be that you have experienced bruising to the anus or there may be other trauma. Tearing, swelling, cuts, dilation of vessels are all possible. It is hard to say what exactly is going on. 

If you are concerned, medical care would be of benefit; especially if you do decide to pursue rape charges. I won't pressure you as that is your decision to make. If you do decide to go that way, go sooner than later to the ER for evaluation. Don't change clothing, go as you are. 

Always remember that this isn't on you and is not your fault, and please be safe.",2701,0,

BACKGROUND (Main point below if you wish to skip):

This is a throwaway and I can’t get into specifics as the person I am afraid of is on this platform. 

However due to a recent decision a judge has made in my case against them, they are very angry. 

They tried to kill me a short while ago using a knife and just found out though a third party they recently spoke about purchasing a gun. 

I am highly concerned and unfortunately my concern doesn’t equal ‘enough evidence’ to put them in jail at the moment.

Side note: I already have a lawyer, family and friend support, and the police are aware. I also have a restraining order but let’s be real, that piece of paper isn’t stopping them from actually showing up to my house/work if they are angry enough. 

I’ve done everything I can from a legal standpoint until they are either sentenced or they attack me, then get arrested. 



MAIN POINT:

I am looking to purchase emergency kit/supplies to keep in my car/home in the event they decide to attack me again.

I understand I would need prompt medical attention. 

Please, what items can I keep in my car/methods to control bleeding would help buy me those precious few moments until help arrives?

Simpler/most vital steps the better as I’m sure being shot/stabbed will make concentrating difficult.

I live in a hotter climate (USA) if that matters as to what I can keep in my vehicle. 

Medical note: I am currently taking a 325mg aspirin, twice a day while an injury heals that has a chance of forming a blood clot. 

Sorry for the novel. I’m almost in tears writing this because I don’t want to die and can’t shake the feeling this isn’t over yet.",988,318,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/kw95eb/help_needed_what_methods_of_care_or_what_items/

(F22),Iveonlyhaddismany,Registered Nurse,2021-01-13 09:09:45,"I wasn't going to weigh in here, because this seems like a subject where even the best of intentions could have deleterious consequences. The kind of interventions being discussed can be difficult for people under ""ordinary"" circumstances, let alone when having to perform them on yourself while under duress, even when properly trained in them. Having a mix of half-baked ideas and faulty recommendations could be more dangerous to you, or just completely useless to you. 

That said, if prevention can't be assured, and falling short of receiving proper medical intervention, there are a few things that should be voiced. I've seen a few recommendations for a tourniquet to stop bleeding. This is not an ideal intervention, for a number of reasons. While I will ultimately say it is always good to have handy, I'd like to first advocate the use of applying pressure first and foremost. A tourniquet requires adequate training for proper use, and if applied wrong, it can cause more harm. Here is why: 

1. Having just been attacked, you will be shaken, quickly begin to succumb to the effects of adrenaline wearing off, and be dealing with the fatigue inherent with blood loss...if bleeding enough to warrant a tourniquet. The chances of you being able to apply it yourself, correctly, and with enough force, are slim. It is more likely that you end up losing valuable time to stop the bleeding, while you try to determine if it is working, and are tinkering. 
2. Holding pressure on a wound, with gauze or clean material, is the fastest way to slow blood flow at a local site, and is often adequate. It requires very little medical inclination. All you need to know is to apply for no less than 15 minutes, and generally longer for more serious wounds, and to not keep checking the bleeding by lifting the bandage, as this will delay the intended effect. The material becomes saturated through with blood, you simply put another layer directly ontop of it, without removing the layer underneath. 
3. Applying it too loosely will stop venous flow but not prevent it from bleeding. 
4. Leaving a tourniquet on too long can do neurovascular damage. Nerve damage may be permanent, affecting sensation and motor functions. Tissue death would also occur if ischemic for long enough. Additionally, if released too soon or suddenly, the return of blood flow can damage compressed blood vessles. 
5. As your blood pressure changes, the force applied needs to be adjusted, and this isn't something that is easily monitored by yourself. 

There are other points, but I'm already running long here. With all of that noted, you may still wish to have one on hand, so keep those points above in mind. Additionally, it must be applied approximately 2 inches above the wound, between the wound and the heart, preferably not over clothing. It is only appropriate on limbs, and if pressure is not effectively stopping the bleeding, or you have multiple injuries that require pressure. It is a life over limb decision, understanding that improper use could cost the limb, but there is no other choice to save your life. The material used should also be only 1 to 2 inches thick; the thicker it is, and the larger the limb, the more force you will need. 

Ideally, if it has come to you having to make this choice, it is because you have gotten yourself to safety, and are able to get help from someone near by, so it isn't left to you to apply. It should remain on for no more than 2 hours, and it should be noted when it was applied, to tell the EMT's. Now, imagine remembering all of this after having been attacked, and losing blood...this is why I want you to remember, PRESSURE, which also works on injuries elsewhere. 

I'm not sure which is least effective, emergency based medical advice from strangers online, or self defense advice online from strangers...so, I'll keep my advice limited to what I've said, and wish you the best.",579,0,

Keep some sort of spray in your purse at all times. Go the legal route possibly mase where you are. Maybe a taser? (I'm in canada and none of this is legal, I don't know what your countries rules are)

When walking, always keep your keys in between your fingers.
NEVER walk between a parked car. Go around. Never walk between 2 parked cars  

Wounds. Gun shot.  Anything that is absorbent and ideally clean. Place and hold pressure. Don't remove to check. You can basically cause the clot that is forming to come off and you have to restart all over again. Just add more layers if needed.

Roll of paper towel, place the whole thing on the area and hold pressure. Wrap if you can 

Knife wound - NEVER remove a knife, or anything that is impaled. 
Stabilize it. Place for example towels around and wrap with gauze.
If item is removed, or any scenario where you are gushing blood. Apply absorbent item, and wrap tightly. You don't necessarily want to make a tourniquet unless there is a lot of blood.

I'm not sure how this part works. But a 2nd phone that is able to call 911. Can you use an old phone that you are no longer paying for to call 911? Or does it need to have a plan? Also great as a decoy. You have to give up your phone? They probably wouldn't think you have 2 phones. 

First aid kit
Flares to get others attention, 
fire extinguisher might not be a bad idea, depends on the temperature where you are. 

Gauze, 
Kling, 
something you could make a tourniquet with if needed - belt - but would also be good just to have to hold material on larger  wounds instead of using all your kling. 

Something to clean a wound - iodine/betadine/rubbing alcohol/vodka
Lighter
Steri strips
medical tape there is paper, plastic, honestly both are good for their own things.
There's also like a vet wrap that would work in a pinch but I'm not sure what it's actually called. 
Very good scissors - something that could cut that belt off if needed.
Flash light - extra batteries 
Towels
Paper towel
Lots of clean Water - depends where you live  - if it freezes don't fill the bottle up all the way. Also good in a pinch if you run out of coolant. But if it freezes you don't need that much water. Because frozen water isn't helpful.

Keep everything you may need car wise
Washer fluid, power steering fluid, brake fluid
Phone charger - spare charger (mine constantly walks away) 

I'm sure I'm missing things first aid wise.

TLDR at the end

So, my mother was extremely against taking meds and seeing doctors unless absolutely necessary. Unless I was over 104 for a day, profusely bleeding, or literally writhing and screaming in pain, she saw it as no big deal. I never got eye exams, check-ups, physicals, vaccines, or any other regular doctor visits. I also saw the dentist maybe twice. Even if I brought up issues.
I began experiencing episodes of shortness of breath, chest pain/tightness, wheezing etc. when doing exercises. She dismissed me saying I was out of shape and over exaggerating. (Note: I've always been fit and active, and she and my whole family smoke in the house) I complained of other issues like joint pain, she'd call me a hypochondriac. I even fell on my elbow once and couldn't move it, sever pain, swelling. She even said 'probably a hair line fracture'. But refused to take me to the doctor saying they'd only tell her what she already knew. And again claimed my pain was exaggerated. I spent the next few months keeping my arm in the centre pocket of sweaters as a diy sling and popping advil. (I was about 15) She cared even less about mental health, even when I told her of my thoughts of suicide. 
I have tried since then to get a new family doctor (didn't have one) but the one I got was less than ideal. She was very keen on treating symptoms and never looking into the cause. Having anxiety (now diagnosed), I haven't yet gotten the courage to give her the ax. Clinic doctors are busy, and I understand that, so they just don't have the time or enough context to really help me fully. 

So, how do I go about finding a doctor that will take my practically non-existent medical records into account and help me to basically catch up on many things never looked into as a child. A doctor who will listen and be patient, and work with me to find whats causing my multiple chronic issues?

TLDR; My mom only went to docs in absolute emergencies. Now I have chronic issues that have never properly been looked into. How do I find a patient and understand doctor who has the time to help me catch up on what I missed and find any underlying issues?

Update: Thank you so much everyone! I've gotten more helpful comments than I can even respond to. I really appreciate all of your advice. If its not too much, I'd like to know if any of you know of how to go about getting a new PCP. Like I mentioned, mine isn't ideal. Never even did all the stuff you guys are saying a doc should do with a medically neglected patient. I live in Canada and there is a service that will help you connect with a family doctor, but since I technically already have one I can't use it. How do I terminate the relationship with my current doc? I think theres maybe paper work I have to do.... The doc is registered with my health card and stuff, so I don't think I can just get a new doc without officially cancelling my relations with my current one and I'm not sure how to do that",965,73,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/gmqjvv/my_mother_was_antidoctor_how_do_i_find_a_doctor/

My PCP is awesome! He's been my doc for nearly 8 years now and we have an actual relationship. He trusts me, I trust him. He knows about the lack of medical care I received in my childhood, and he's super patient with me when I ask dumb questions. 

I recommend finding a PCP in your area who is part of your insurance network. Your first visit is longer than normal because the MD needs time to collect a through history. Just be honest, and thorough. It's important to let him/her know that you were medically neglected because it's going to affect how they treat you. (Medically treat you, not treat you as a person.)

This is my last resort here and I’m asking for any and all opinions from people with experience, know someone one with experience, professionals, school teachers professors or students....... 


My boyfriend and I just had a little girl a few months ago. He’s been sick since before I met him. I’ll go over the basics that I know. Nobody can figure out what it is and we are waiting for the Mayo Clinic to get back to us. He’s went from 220lbs to 150lbs. It started slow but the past 2 years is when it really started to get bad. 


To start with some background,(may not necessarily relate to the issues) he used to have liver and kidney issues and ended up in the hospital because he almost had liver and kidney failure from alcoholism. He chews tobacco and has his whole life (since he was 12). He used to swallow his spit with a chew in while he was in high school. He used to spray weeds a year before this all started up and weed killer fell all over him. He also has had kidney stones and hasn’t had the best diet. He’s like addicted to sprite. He’s had a very active lifestyle also, working a laborious job running heavy equipment Anyway, he also got beat severely growing up from when he was a young kid to age 12.He never really goes to the hospital either. He’s been sick for 4 years and went a few times here and there and never got an answer so he gave up. Then he met me 2 years ago and so here is what’s wrong, and the progress we have had. 


His symptoms started as just pain and nausea and vomiting every time he ate food. It would take an hour to kick in. And then it started to only take 30 min. The pain would subside substantially once he vomited. But over the past year it’s gotten to where the pain never stops no matter what and food makes it worse. The weight loss started at around 1-2lbs a month and then advanced to 4lbs a month. He has no energy for anything, frequently seems out of it, his stomach is always making loud noises. He hasn’t had a solid stool in like 8 months. His throat is sore and his voice is hoarse and has changed a bit (maybe from throwing up). He had a lump in his throat (swollen lymph node) and got it checked out. His lower back is always in tremendous pain (maybe becuase of his job constantly bouncing up and down in a machine or maybe something else). He also gets lightheaded and has fainted a handful of times. His pain in his stomach is in his upper left abdomen and lower right as well. The pain is so bad that he is constantly curling himself inward as if he’s trying to be in fetal position. No pain meds work. We have tried every diet under the sun. Nothing helps.  No relief. He throws up liquids solids.... a cracker... he simply can’t eat. It’s really sad. So now let me get into what we DO know. 


The only things the doctors have discovered that I’m aware of are that he has an elevated white blood cell count, they can’t find cancer anywhere, there’s 0 abnormalities (come to find out there are a few ‘minor’ ones that the doctors failed to maybe link together into a diagnosis. I’ll get into that in a second), he has fatty liver disease, kidney issues (not sure what), kidney stones, an intestinal ulcer or two. 

The colonoscopy and endoscopy found nothing but the ulcers they didn’t do anything about. They did a swallow test with eggs and dye. Didn’t find anything. They did some CT scans tons of bloodwork, MRI, tested his pooop and urine, did the esophagus test where they cost your throat... they haven’t found anything except for this past week we realized (his primary doctor called him) and said that he reviewed all the results and what his Gastro didn’t think much of, could be a bigger issue. His intestines are super tense and flexed so it’s hard for food to pass through. And his stomach is digesting at 60% as per the normal 40%. So he is digesting food at a faster rate. They also found that the food in his stomach just sits there. He tries to eat a bunch at night and takes his sedative to sleep so he can try to digest some food. The food just sits in his intestines for hours upon hours until he throws it up becuase only a small amount of food digests before the rest just sits in his stomach. They said his stomach is so so so acidic cuz of all the food just sitting there. It’s called dumping syndrome. Oh also one last thing, he has a bunch of moles and some new ones I haven’t seen. He has had a sore on his ear that hurts since I met him, too. He’s a white male and 6’4 and 28 years old. 


Doctors have thought he had Reflux, crohns, pancreatitis, liver cancer, lymphoma... probably amongst many other things. But no luck finding the root of his problems. The pain, and the puking!


Please we need some help. We don’t know what to do or where to go and I know he probably doesn’t have much longer if we don’t find an answer. Any insight is appreciated. We don’t know where to go from here. He has insurance and we will spend whatever it takes. I will do whatever it takes so he can be here for his 3 kids.",937,191,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/mfcan8/death_is_around_the_corner_unless_we_find_answers/

This sounds like a FUNCTIONAL obstruction of his intestines. It needs to be delineated as either a mechanical obstruction (think like a bent garden hose) or a dysmotility disorder (think paralyzed intestines or stomach)

The advice above by non doctors is what happens when people with half knowledge chime in and why i agree with mods deleting “NAD but...” comments. Its aggravating I have to waste time countermanding their advice, but:

-Placing A feeding tube without knowing if there’s a blockage will make him sicker and could kill him. It would cause a leak and kill him
-gallbladder could be ruled out with one test, and I am assuming based on the battery of tests that they checked it
-gastroparesis is also a possibility but can also be ruled out with a very very simple radiological study which he could have easily already had.
-lyme is a possible cause, but again ALSO simply ruled out with a blood test.
-SIBO also possible, but extremely unlikely to be this extreme.

Your boyfriend has what is an extreme illness and I agree its gotten to life threatening levels. Help goes beyond posting here, and I am willing to get professionally involved. Even if need be via telehealth (if you’re near NYC area maybe in person) but lets take this offline here and you can PM me to discuss how best to proceed.

If he were my patient, I would start by personally reviewing every single test he had, which he was missing, and look at the radiological films with my own eyes, not the radiologists interpretations of them only (cant tellyou how many of these kinds of cases i have solved just by doing this and catching something the radiologists missed). If he hasnt had them already, he needs an Upper GI series with small bowel follow through immediately, and if thats normal he needs a gastric emptying study followed by a motility study (he swallows washers and has serial xrays after). If those are normal, THEN he can have a feeding tube to get started. 

His liver failure history is alarming as well, and could be related.

Hope he feels better, and for the first time here I am inviting you (and only you) to DM me if he is that dire so I could hopefully stem disaster.

Some questions to ask him before you reach out:
-has he had surgery in his abdomen before?
-can he tolerate liquids? Do the symptoms only occur with solid foods but not liquid?
-how often does he have bowel movements? Are they abnormal in any way when he does? Diarrhea? Thin and pencil like? Bloody?
-when he got “beat up” did he ever take beatings into the abdomen? Especially enough to cause injury to his spleen or liver?
-does he have any unusual genetic conditions that run in the family? Especially tumors or cancer?
-did he get the ear ulcer biopied? (If not he needs this IMMEDIATELY)
-what pesticide did he get covered in and how often was exposure?
-has he seen a surgeon? Has anyone considered a diagnostic laparoscopy?
-does he have a CT of his abdomen WITH contrast? Or was it done without contrast?

There are more but these are whats needed to get started...

*ps- holy cow, you guys are really generous with the awards and upvotes. Thank you, sincerely. I just hope to get OP’s SO better.

*update: am completely humbled by all the positive feedback. I’m not a guy who’s comfortable with praise or complements—but I am completely grateful to you all, never had anything on reddit get these kinds of awards or upvotes. I havent heard from OP—and am kind of worried, but hopeful she took my guidance to her local md team and hopefully they are moving in the right direction.
On a side note, am a little concerned that caring about suffering patients seems to have become the exception instead of the norm from my profession. Its kind of a wake up call that the house of medicine needs to put patients out front and center of every single healthcare move we make, and while I practice that way, maybe I shouldnt abide others doing it the other way. 
Anyways, thanks again, and you’ve certainly given me food for thought while I consider how to bring back “old school” medicine, that doesnt resemble going to a costco or sams club.
And as for so many that reached out with similar complaints—(I’m shocked at how many you are) I’d have to take a week off of surgeries just to get to you all! I’m so sorry i havent even been able to respond to you all, but will try to squeeze in a reply here or there between patients or surgeries.

Gastroparesis is extremely painful for most people, and often leads to vomiting with other symptoms of reflux like you describe (weight loss, sore throat, voice changes). 

Gastroparesis and ulcers are also likely leading to downstream effects (intestinal spasm, diarrhea, and possibly even SIBO as mentioned in another comment, although there’s still a lot we don’t know about SIBO).

First, the hardest part- he has to stop all his bad habits. All of them. Stop the soda, unhealthy foods, tobacco, and alcohol (tapering alcohol in a safe manner if he still uses it). Sorry to be blunt, but gastroparesis is a condition we don’t have great treatments for and the smallest slip ups can cause a flare. It’s also not really fixable in most cases, just manageable. He may want to get an opinion from a new GI doc with a focus on gastroparesis to get the most comprehensive plan in place.

He may benefit from a combination of acid suppressing medications- omeprazole (potentially with ranitidine and sucralfate with meals, although there is disagreement about the role of more than one) along with a ‘prokinetic’ medication- one that encourages the stomach to empty appropriately- like metoclopramide.

Unfortunately, his plan of eating a larger meal at night and taking a sedative medication is probably working against him, as many sedative medications can slow the bowels down too.

Also, another hard thing to hear is that many strong pain medications can also worsen the symptoms and cause a flare. It’s one of the many truly unfair things about gastroparesis.

I’m sorry he’s going through this, but hopefully he can discover the exact right combination of things to help.",160,0,

I’ve encountered lots of wonderful, compassionate physicians over the years but this one bad encounter with a doctor is really haunting me. I am a 20 y/o college student and last summer, I had to see an ob/gyn for a menstrual cycle issue. Without going into too much detail, I was a virgin seeing an ob/gyn for the first time, and it was not a great experience. He dove in without explaining or discussing anything, and he was incredibly rushed and callous. I was in a lot of pain and he just continued with no reaction. I did not get anything from this encounter, as he didn’t even address the problem I came for.

After my appointment, I sat in the waiting room and debated whether or not to speak to him. I didn’t want to cause a scene, but I was truly upset over what had happened. So, I asked to talk to him at the end of his workday. I told him that I wasn’t comfortable with what had happened during my appointment, and I wish he had taken the time to discuss and explain things before he did them. He justified his actions, which I expected, but he also apologized for making me feel uncomfortable. And that was good enough for me. 

Fast forward to today. I was looking through my visit notes on this EMR for a different encounter, and I am completely shocked to find a scathing “progress note” left by this ob/gyn in my medical record. In this note he proceeds to call me “very difficult to deal with,” “immature,” and “delusional” (?). The note was genuinely jaw dropping to read. He questions why I even came to see an ob/gyn if I didn’t “already know I was going to have those exams done.” It was just three paragraphs of very harsh comments with no objective information about my health at all. 

I am at a loss of words, because I was in no way aggressive, confrontational, or even rude when I spoke to this doctor. Hell, I was there alone and I was just scared. I felt satisfied after he had apologized, and put all of it behind me, only to find this as a nice little surprise a year later. While I understand that he was probably just trying to cover his ass in case of any legal trouble, I still think it is extremely unprofessional that he left this kind of a note in my medical record. 

Now, more than a year later, he has retired and I can’t even contact his office to remove it. From my understanding, you can’t remove notes from a patient’s medical record anyway. I am worried that his comments will follow me forever and affect my ability to receive unbiased care in the future. I don’t even know what to do at this point…would it still be possible to do anything about this? Any advice would be really appreciated.

&#x200B;

36F, 5’5, 115 lb, white.  Primary complaint = fingers and toes turning black and rotten (pictures included).  

Existing issues = random red cell destruction without cause, random platelet destruction without cause, swellings and rashes (labs and pictures included).  Medications = iron supplement.  Occasional Claritin, Advil, Prednisone.  No medication right now.  No recreational drugs or smoking.  Rare/light alcohol (an occasional drink on holidays or weddings)  

1. Rotten Fingers.

My left thumb got a blood blister so I put Neosporin and gauze on it.  The pain became so intense that I went 72 hours without sleep.  I went to urgent care, who removed the bandage.  The thumb was very swollen and the top third was black and crusty.  

(picture)

They sent me to the Emergency Room, where they removed the upper half of the thumb.  The pain completely went away, it was just a little sore and itchy.

But a few days later, all the other fingers and 8 of the toes started turning black.

(pictures)

That’s the hand with the original bad thumb.  The pinkie has a blood blister, the index and ring fingers are turning black and crusting at the very top under the nail, and the middle finger is just inky blue/black without any crustiness or blisters.  The left picture was taken a day after the right one.  

Right Hand:  no crustiness or blisters.  The fingers are just dark.  The index finger is getting kind of gooey (last picture).

(pictures)

Toes look blacker than fingers but not crusty.  All but the two smallest toes on right foot are turning black.

The ER doctors were very kind but nobody knew why my thumb turned black and rotten.  

**Now here are all the other weird symptoms and bloodtests that doctors can’t explain.  None of it seemed like a big deal untl fingers started rotting.**  

**2.** **Rotting Blood** 

For years my annual bloodwork showed I was anemic.  For example

(picture)

But I had no symptoms of anemia other than feeling cold, so my NP said being anemic was just “my normal” and prescribed an iron supplement.

Two or three times a year, I would get symptoms of extreme exhaustion that would last a few weeks.  Most of the time, I felt healthy. But for those weeks, I would sleep the entire weekend, wake up Monday, stumble brain dead through the workday, then get home and fall right back asleep.  After a few weeks, I’d start to get better.  For years, my NP said it was nothing, just a virus.  But I never felt sick, just exhausted.  

Then a doctor saw me while it was happening.  As soon as she saw me, she took my vitals, looked at my eyes, and said, “this isn’t all in your head.  We need to take your blood.”  

Here were those blood results

(picture)

It turns out that the exhaustion is because my blood starts rotting a few times a year.  

I went to hematology.  They tested me for every possible cause of blood destruction.  But everything was normal.

Tests included DAT/Coombs negative, PNH w/ FLAER “no flow cytometric evidence of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria” “No evidence of aberrant loss of GPI-linked markers tested in erythroid or leukocyte populations. Anti-CD45, glycophorin A, CD59, CD24, CD15, CD64, and FLAER tested.” Complement: C3C, C4C normal, CH50 high (>60). Cold hemagluttinins: “none detected”, G6PD - high (>21.00). No hereditary spherocytosis or elliptocytosis. Infections negative.  Blood cultures normal.

I can post the tests if anyone needs to see them.

**3.** **Bruises and Rotting Platelets**

Normally I don’t bruise any more than most people.   But once in a while, I get bruises everywhere.  My bra, underwear, and socks all leave big bruises.  They’re painless and go away in a couple weeks so I never worried about it.  But when a doctor saw and tested, it turned out there were almost no platelets.  

The picture shows the bruising left by a loose sock.  My whole shins were just big bruises that followed the pattern of the sock elastic.

(picture)

In a few weeks they were back up to 40 and the bruises were gone.  

Hematologist found no reason for platelets to suddenly drop like this.  

They checked for cancers and even took bone marrow but no answers.

(picture)

All the bone marrow tests like fish and genetics were normal.  

**4.** **Symptoms that Seem Autoimmune but Have No Rheumatologic Cause.**  

Sometimes I get rashes and swellings that doctors think is autoimmune

(pictures)

Rheumatology has tested EVERYTHING again and again.  Sedimentation rate, ferritin, and CRP are always high.  But nothing else is usually abnormal.

(pictures)

They biopsied some of the rashes and purpuras (which I don’t have pictures of, they’re just little painless red spots that sometimes break out on my legs).  They all showed the same thing, “leukocyto elastic vasculitis”.  Here’s one.

(picture)

But every other type of test for vasculitis has been negative.   Nobody has explained why someone healthy and pretty young like me should have ‘chronic venous insufficiency’ either.

I have only had one round of tests where there were any abnormal autoimmune results:

(picture)

But these things were only abnormal that ONE TIME.  Rheumatology has re-tested them so many more times and they are always normal.  They have tested for every other autoimmune disease and they are all normal.  

The only rheumatology tests that are often abnormal are sediment rate, creactive, and ferritin being high.   Ddimer and visc is sometimes high but not usually.  PT, INR, and ptt are sometimes high too.  

(picture)

They don’t think it’s cryoglobinemia because it was only positive once and negative a lot more times.  Also, my C4 was always high or normal and my C3 was always normal, even in the test where there was cryoglobulin.  

(picture)

The only other thing off on the bloodwork is subclinical hypothyroid.   TSH is high, but T3 and 4 are low normal.  I have no symptoms of  hypothyroid other than being cold.  And the cold could be from anemia. 

**Please, does anybody know what this all means?**

I had accepted the lack of answers when it was just random blood rotting, swelling, and rashes.  I know the doctors tried hard.  I could live with all that stuff.  

But these black fingers, I can’t live with it.  It hurts too much. 

It feels like someone as healthy as me shouldn’t have all these symptoms unless it’s connected somehow.  But nobody knows how.  Rheumatology thinks the rotten blood is not autoimmune because Coombs and other autoimmune tests are always normal.  But hematology says if it’s not autoimmune, then there’s no other answers.  

So far, I have no autoimmune diagnoses but doctors still act like I have something autoimmune.

Monday I will see my NP and can ask for any tests anybody recommends.

**IS THERE ANYTHING I CAN DO FOR THE FINGERS AND TOES?  TO MAKE THE BLACK GO AWAY OR MAKE THEM STOP HURTING?**

I already tried asking a pain forum for tips, but I got a nasty message (“Your complaining about 2 weeks of hurt fingers!  Do you understand that we have pain that is severe, intractable and forever*?*  I have ddd and a herniated L5-S1 disc.  I am in 10/10 agony beyond your imagination.  Your hurty finger is a joke.  Suck it up buttercup”) so I deleted it and won’t ask for help from patients again.

I hope doctors will be more understanding. *I get it*, that there are other people who have it much, much worse.   But I don’t have chronic pain so I never developed a high pain tolerance.  Typing this is killing me. I’ve had a broken bones, a vaginal delivery, wisdom tooth surgery, and swollen joints, but none of those hurt that bad.  When I’ve broken a bone, it’s only been blindingly painful for ten or fifteen minutes, then it settles down.  Then a few days of throbbing and aching that’s relieved with rest and Advil.  

This is the first time I’ve had pain that Advil can’t relieve and that doesn’t settle down with time or rest.  I know other people with bad backs or arthritis have it worse.  I don’t need to be told that.  But *for me*, this is too much.  

**What can cause this?**

The doctors seem confident that it’s *not* just psychological.

But I can’t shake the fact that I get more symptoms when I’m sad or stressed.  I don’t have any chronic mental illnesses, but I go through short periods of feeling down or anxious.  At the hospital, I held it together when they took off the black thumb.  I told myself that it was ok, that the pain was finally gone, that half a thumb isn’t that important, that it’s my non-dominant hand, that I don’t need a full left thumb to type or do most activities.  When I got home, I was so happy to be pain free and I had so much to catch up on, I just didn’t think about it.  But then I looked at the discharge paperwork and saw that under “Reason For Visit,” they wrote “GANGRENE, WET”.  I knew that the thumb wasn’t good, but seeing it called “GANGRENE” made me feel so repulsive and sad.  I spent 10 or 15 minutes just crying.  

It was right after that little breakdown that all the other fingers started hurting and turning black.  Could all that crying have caused it?

There’s also an odd discrepancy.  My black fingers hurt so much but my black toes don’t hurt at all.  How is that possible unless the pain is all in my head?

I am desperate for answers or relief if anyone can help.  **Thank you to anyone who has read this far.**

Some type of small vessel vasculitis fits best, but they’ve tested for all the obvious culprits so it’s hard to say why nothing has been found yet. It’s definitely not in your head, but it’s no surprise that stress makes the symptoms worse. Stress makes a lot of things worse.

73,Post,owb2jb,Medical mystery solved? Update on wife [34F] getting repeated 1-day fevers after visiting brother's house. One remaining question about infections...,winampman,Layperson/not verified as healthcare professional.,1627896537.0,"Six months ago, I asked you guys about my wife getting mysterious repeated 1-day fevers after visiting her brother's house. It seemed like no one was 100% sure of the cause. (I don’t blame you guys, this was very unusual): [https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/kzrnny/wife\_34f\_gets\_a\_1day\_fever\_after\_visiting/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/kzrnny/wife_34f_gets_a_1day_fever_after_visiting/)

One new thing that happened: A couple months later, *I* started getting fevers after visiting brother's house too. Sometimes I would get it but not her. Our symptoms were consistent with some kind of bacterial/viral infection. But we ruled out food and water - we still got fevers despite not drinking any of their water, and despite ordering take-out from reputable restaurants that we've had many times in the past with no problem.

Where else could there be bacteria growing in their house? We live in a non-humid dry area, it's a relatively new house, no leaking pipes or anything... then that's when it hit me: **There's a small humidifier in my niece's room!** (what’s funny is that [I mentioned the humidifier in a comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/kzrnny/wife_34f_gets_a_1day_fever_after_visiting/gjt59hl/) in my original post, but my brain failed to make the connection... *sigh*) 

So I did some reading on humidifiers... like [this](https://www.sylvane.com/blog/maintain-your-humidifier-and-health/), and [this](https://www.medicinenet.com/humidifier_fever/definition.htm), and [even another redditor](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/kd08cv/product_question_help_finding_a_humidifier_that/). These articles are probably not the best scientific sources, so I found this too: [**https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/nioshtic-2/00213601.html**](https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/nioshtic-2/00213601.html) It's a 1993 study published in the *American Journal of Industrial Medicine*. A summary:

1. One day, 16 out of 31 employees at a store suddenly all developed fevers and chills.
2. ""The onset of symptoms ranged from 5 to 13 hours after entering the workplace, with a median onset being 7 hours. The illness lasted 2 to 24 hours."" This matches our fever symptoms exactly.
3. ""A humidifier had been operating for the first time in many months on the day of the outbreak. An examination of the humidifier revealed that the baffles were covered with brownish grey sludge as it had not been cleaned since it had been purchased 19 months earlier."" Also, there was poor ventilation that day.
4. ""Organisms isolated from the humidifier sludge included three species of the fungus Fusarium, ameba of the genus Acanthamoeba, and Gram negative bacteria.""

Also, I started thinking about the full timeline of events, and the facts matched up:

1. **Why did my wife get fevers first, but not me?** Because for the first few months, my wife would babysit and go inside niece's room (where the humidifier was located) to put her down for a nap, and/or put her down to bed at night. I did not babysit, and when I was at their house I would stay in the living room and wait for her.
2. **Why did I start getting fevers later?** Because after a few months, my wife convinced me to help with our niece, which required going inside niece's room. So then I started spending \~30-45 minutes inside niece's room each time.
3. **Why did we sometimes** ***not*** **get any fever after going to brother’s house?** Because we didn’t always go inside niece's room. On some visits, we just ate a meal together and/or stayed in the living room. Note - We didn't *always* get fevers when going inside niece's room. I think on those occasions, we didn't stay in the room long enough (e.g., just popped in to say goodbye), and/or they may have turned on the AC recently when the house felt stuffy, which would have pumped fresh air into the room.

Armed with this knowledge, we shared it with brother and his wife. He shared some more info: He was inexperienced with humidifiers, and did not know anything about humidifier maintenance. He confirmed that 1) he had never cleaned the humidifier since buying it late last year, 2) turned it on every night, 3) used unfiltered tap water for the humidifier’s water source, and 4) during the winter months he never uses the house heater (we have mild winters) so there was zero ventilation in niece's room. The humidifier is made of black plastic, so it’s difficult to see dirty water, but when I examined the humidifier in person, I pointed out a couple 1mm moldy green dots at the mouth of the humidifier. He immediately removed the humidifier and cleaned it upon seeing it. We have not had any fevers since then.

So then this leads to my final question for you guys: **Why did we get fevers after inhaling dirty humidifier air for under an hour, but brother, niece, and his wife seemed to have zero symptoms?** They never reported having any fevers/chills like we did. Can people develop immunity/antibodies for some bacteria/fungus? Or are some people/families just naturally immune to some bacteria? 

Patient info: Wife is 34 Female, height 5'8"", weight 127lb, race asian. My info is similar, within 5% of my wife.",912,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/owb2jb/medical_mystery_solved_update_on_wife_34f_getting/

Over the weekend, I \[40m\] tested positive for COVID. I called my doctor today and he's insisting on putting me on four medications: a steroid (""to help with reducing inflammation""), an antibiotic (""to prevent a secondary infection from setting in such as pneumonia""), as well as both Ivermectin and Hydroxychloroquine (""to help with the virus"" - he gave no further explanation on that one). 

During our conversation, he also said I shouldn't have gotten COVID at all because I'm vaccinated and boosted (I got my third shot at the end of November) and maybe next time I'll ""think twice"" about the vaccine. He also said that I'll now develop ""natural immunity"" so I should be okay for a while.

Now, I'm not a doctor, but I have heard nothing about Ivermectin or Hydroxychloroquine being of any actual benefit for COVID patients. Also, I was under the impression that no vaccine in history has ever been 100% effective, but he seemed to be indicating the opposite. Finally, I didn't think ""natural immunity"" was inherently better than immunity gained from a vaccine. If I am wrong about any of these, please correct me.

Anyway, the whole conversation just left me feeling really uncomfortable and I'm not sure if I want him to be my doctor anymore.

Is this a medical emergency?,smoskira,Layperson/not verified as healthcare professional.,1613159125.0,"21F, 5'3"", 175 lbs. The neurological issues started around the same time the tooth got infected, over a year ago, but I couldn't get a root canal because it was going to be $3k even though I have insurance (thanks America). The other day my tooth randomly bled, and I mean filled my mouth with blood. I also have a few more cavities that aren't really that bad but my gums around them are swelling. Ever since then, my neurological symptoms are the worst they've ever been. One minute I'll be fine, the next I won't know what the hell is even going on. My chest is killing me too. Is this a medical emergency? Would an emergency room do anything to help? I set an appointment with a local dentist online that helps low income and I finally got on medicaid so I figure they'll just rip it out, but they haven't gotten back to me, most likely because of the snow in my area. I'm worried that I have an infection.

Neuro problems are: headache, confusion, tachycardia (POTS), flu like feeling, head pressure like it's full of liquid, neck stiffness, memory issues, and more confusion. 

It may be worth noting a few weeks ago I had to go to the hospital with meningitis symptoms and after a spinal tap they told me it wasn't meningitis but I was fighting a nasty virus.

Edited to update: went to the ER. They didn't draw blood or anything but the doctor did check my tooth out, said it was infected and sent my script to the pharmacy to pick up tomorrow. The doctor thinks the bleeding episode was my tooth being abscessed and then draining itself. I also have pharyngitis. As for the other symptoms (neck, headache and confusion) I had the same symptoms about 3 weeks back, went to the hospital and got diagnosed with and unknown viral illness (after testing negative for meningitis). The doctor thinks I could have the illness again, but this time nobody else in my house is sick but me so I don't know. I see a dentist Monday, and we're supposed to get 16 inches of snow this weekend so I'm hoping that the antibiotics will take care of everything. Thank you guys so much for the support.

I choked on a cup of coffee the other day at work, just went down the wrong hole. Lol. And had a coughing fit, and my boss comes over and sends me home.

I have allergies every single year no matter how much Claritin I take.  

Tried coming back and he said don't come back until you have a doctor's note.  

So I called my doctor, and he said don't come in unless you're having covid-19 symptoms.  I asked if he could just write me a note to return to work, and he told me he can't unless he examines in person. But he won't let me come in unless I think I have the virus.  

And honestly I'm glad, I don't want to go to the doctors office right now.  I feel like that would be the prime place to catch covid-19.

Help us diagnose her.",Critical_Advice_1256,Layperson/not verified as healthcare professional,1621302210.0,"Hoping we can get some ideas as to what's wrong with our 1F daughter. We've seen her pediatrician and several specialists. Nothing has improved.

The problem became apparent when she was 4 weeks old. She developed belly pain, blood and mucous in her stool, diarrhea, thrashing/arching, screaming, rashy skin, eczema, hives, painful gas, and silent reflux. She is breastfed, and at 2 months old, her pediatrician recommended removing dairy from my wife’s diet. This change led to enough improvement around the clock that we were able to start to detect patterns of reactions from other foods.

Between the ages of 2.5-4.5 months, through detailed food journaling, my wife also eliminated oats, peanuts, wheat, tree nuts (almonds/cashews), and coconut from her diet, all of which produced some combination of the symptoms noted above. 

Since initial diagnosis:

* At 5 months old, skin prick allergy testing for all known triggers was negative, and the allergist diagnosed her with Food Protein Induced Allergic Proctocolitis (FPIAP), an illness related to the more severe FPIES.
* At 5 months old, we introduced solids. Every. Single. Food. caused some combination of rashy skin, dark circles around her eye(s), diarrhea, screaming/thrashing in pain, perceived abdominal cramping, eczema outbreaks, painful gas, etc.
   * Solids we tried and failed include: carrots, sweet potato, pear, broccoli, peanut butter.
* At 6.5 months old, gastroenterologist #1 recommended Nutramigen and Pepcid, which we introduced separately, and both caused reactions. 
* GI #1 also recommended cutting soy from mom’s diet, which we did. 
* At 7.5 months old, our immunologist thought it might be T-cell related, but thought it was a GI problem and didn’t have a clear answer, so referred us to GI #2.
* At 8 months old, GI #1 ordered labs: immunophenotyping, tryptase (to rule out MCAS), and CBC w/ differential. 
   * Results were mostly normal, except: minimally increased naive cytotoxic T cells, slightly elevated platelets, and slightly elevated neutrophils. 
   * GI #1 attributed these results to an acute infection like a cold. Problem is, the kid wasn’t sick. She wasn’t reacting either - she was totally at baseline at the time of the blood draw.
* By this time, her pediatrician and all specialists agreed we needed to push through skin reactions and mild gas or discomfort to get her acclimated to eating something - anything. 
   * Conditions for stopping food trials would 1) profuse diarrhea, 2) blood in stool, 3) inconsolable pain.
   * At 8 months old, we successfully introduced avocado and banana by pushing through minor symptoms.
* At 8.5 months old, we introduced Puramino (elemental formula), and she had excessive diarrhea.
* At 8.5 months old, GI #2 diagnosed her with FPIAP, and recommended reintroducing allergens into mom’s diet, slowly, one at a time. 
* At 9 months old, mom reintroduced wheat, starting with 1/4 slice of bread per day. The first two days went well enough, so mom increased to 1/2 slice per day. Within 30 minutes after nursing, baby was covered in hives. (Remember - allergy testing was negative.) Mom dropped back down to 1/4 slice for another 4 days. Baby was increasingly fussy, uncomfortable, gassy, rashy, worsening eczema, and just… out of it. So after day 7, we stopped. The next day, baby was perfect - happy, bubbly, giggly, wonderful.

Our symptoms of a failed introduction often begin with skin rashes within 1-3 hours after food consumption (sometimes a bit longer if via breastmilk), and other symptoms escalate over the course of the day, usually ending with the screaming/thrashing/cramping belly pain by the evening. The acute reaction which we see the same day as a fail usually resolve quickly (within 24 hours), but lingering symptoms like diarrhea, or blood/mucous in the stool can take up to two weeks to return to baseline.

To us, the diagnosis of FPIAP does not add up. Blood in the stool and mucousy/watery stool are classic FPIAP symptoms, sure. Most kids with FPIAP are sensitive to dairy and/or soy, typically react to no more than a couple of foods total, and outgrow their reactions between 9-12 months. Our daughter reacts to everything, even elemental formula and Pepcid, and her symptoms are more than just bloody poop.

TL;DR What condition would cause allergy-like reactions to 13 foods plus formulas, AND have elevated T cells/platelets/neutrophils?",731,140,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/nexx26/1f_my_infant_daughter_is_9_months_old_and_is_an/

This is also a good time for a trial off breast milk with an amino acid formula.  I usually try it for a month or so and have mom keep pumping so she can resume breastfeeding after the trial.  If it really is FPIES, it should resolve with that.

93,Post,gu7xwt,HELP! Abnormal Menstrual Bleeding,DangerousBall6,Layperson/not verified as healthcare professional.,1590962453.0,"Please help! Any advice is appreciated. Long post here so please bear with me. I’m a 32 year old, married female, overall healthy. 

I started on BC pills when I was about 15 years old. My period had always been very regular with minimal cramping and bleeding. Had never had an issue with my menstrual cycle up until I turned 30. 

Once I hit 30 everything changed. My periods suddenly became VERY heavy and irregular. I’d have periods where I bled for weeks on end, I had to start doubling up on a pad and tampon to be able to leave the house for more than an hour at a time.  I started seeing very alarming sized clots, golf ball up to palm sized. 

After dealing with this for about 6 months my annual exam with my Ob/Gyn of roughly 10 years came up. During this exam she mentioned switching BC pills since I’d been on the same ones for years. I agreed, and thought maybe that was why my cycle suddenly and so drastically changed. 

I tried to acclimate to new BC pills for close to a year, continuing to bleed profusely for weeks at a time. I again met with my Ob/Gyn, this time she suspected an issue. I stressed to her my wedding was coming up in 6 months (December 28 2019) and I’d really prefer to NOT be dealing with this during our wedding and honeymoon. She prescribed me Lysteda to start taking when I started bleeding. 

At this point she performed a Sonohysterogram and found a fibroid, around 4 cm, which she attributed to the heavy bleeding, she also biopsied the fibroid, everything being benign. 

Because of the upcoming wedding she decided to schedule me for surgery to to do a hysterscopy and a D&C, and also insert an IUD (mirena) as we felt the pill was no longer the best option. I had this procedure done on 10/01/2019. 

I noticed an immediate improvement with the heavy bleeding, however I was in excruciating pain multiple times a day. When I went for my post surgery follow up roughly a month later, my regular Ob/Gyn that performed the surgery was out of office so I saw a different doctor. He said the IUD placement looked great and that cramping was normal in the first 3 to 6 months. 

We made it through our wedding and honeymoon, arriving home around mid January 2020. The pain from the IUD wasn’t getting better but I continued to have very minimal bleeding. 

Finally in March I decided the pain was too much so I wanted my IUD removed. I visited my doctor on 3/23/20 for removal, at which point she did mention the IUD had moved from where she had originally placed it. I had light spotting the day it was removed. 

On 3/27/20 I started bleeding profusely once again. I was sitting outside with my husband when suddenly I felt a gush, and a HUGE clot the size of a lemon came out of me, I ran to our restroom to clean up, gushing blood all over our hallway and bathroom. The bleeding being so severe I was soaking through an adult diaper every hour. My bleeding continued on like this for the next 15 days until about 4/10. 

While the COVID situation was happening I sought a second option from a family friend who was willing to see me at their practice. She did an ultrasound and found that my fibroid has grown back and is roughly 4 cm again. She also prescribed me a 3 month BC pill, Seasonale, to try and control the bleeding so I’d only deal with bleeding once every three months. I started the Seasonale on 4/14/20. This doctor didn’t seem overly concerned the fibroid grew back so quickly. 

I began heavy spotting again on 5/15 and I have started bleeding profusely for the last 12 days (mind you I am one month into the 3 month pack and i am bleeding just as severely as before my surgery). 

I have a doctors appointment scheduled for this Monday- 6/1/20 with my original Ob/Gyn. Any ideas of what could be going on or suggestions of things I should ask my doctor. I will include a pic of a clot I had this morning, this is about an average size clot for me.  

I can barely function and have a normal life with this level of bleeding for this duration. I need to figure this out and get a more permanent fix. [typical clot](https://imgur.com/a/TohkEMk)

Edit 2- THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH!!!!!!!!!!!  I am doing okay today, still bleeding though.  I was able to speak with the emergency line for my doctors office several times yesterday, shockingly I am not really dizzy or lightheaded.  I have been drinking lots of fluids to stay hydrated and taking the Lysteda (Tranexamic Acid) and ibuprofen as my doctor ordered.  I have an appointment with my obgyn of over 10 years this afternoon- don't worry, my husband will be driving me.  I should have included in my OP that my husband and I would like to preserve my fertility and try for a family in about a year, assuming we can figure this issue out so an ablation or hysterectomy is out of the question unless there was something seriously wrong and that was our only option.",722,108,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/gu7xwt/help_abnormal_menstrual_bleeding/
94,Comment,gu7xwt,HELP! Abnormal Menstrual Bleeding,Unknown,,2020-06-01 02:19:26,"Hello, and I’m so sorry you going through this.

Off the bat: bleeding more than two pads an hour for two hours or being dizzy/lightheaded means you should at least talk to the on call doc, if not be seen tonight.

Regarding your abnormal bleeding. I’ll run you through basically all the reasonable possibilities:

Fibroids - you have one. This is reasonable given its size. You can have it removed or try hormonal control. At this point it might be reasonable to try a mirena again. Could alternatively try depo provera but I hate that long term. The nexplanon is associated with irregular bleeding but might be a more tolerable amount. 

Adenomyosis - endometrium that is present in your uterine muscle. Only options are hormones or hysterectomy. This is possible but less likely. Given that the Mirena did help at one point I wouldn’t worry too much about feeling like someone is going to tell you that your uterus needs to come out.

Polyps - not your problem

Cancer/precancer - unlikely 

Coagulopthy - unlikely

Ovulatory dysfunction - definitely possible. Most common should be checked for PCOS and thyroid dysfunction.

Medications or the hormones themselves - it’s always possible the drugs you are on are responsible for your bleeding but given your history this is less likely.

What to do: consider repeat Mirena. Nexplanon or depo provera may be ok choices temporarily but not long term (at least not depo. Plus nexplanon isn’t really targeted for heavy bleeding patients but can help). You should get checked for pcos and thyroid issues. Having that fibroid totally removed is an option but they can grow back or you can get new ones. You could also try the nuvaring or the patch but to be honest they are similar to oral birth control. Lastly if you want to become pregnant soon then being on progesterone for about 10 days out of the month might be enough to keep your bleeding tolerable and have a shot at pregnancy. Continuing Lysteda is an option as well however is hard for prolonged or unpredictable bleeding. 

Lastly going on something like Lupron or Orlissa (puts you in temporary medical menopause) is only a temporary solution. It can shrink your fibroid but it will regrow. 

Happy to clarify more.

Edit: someone else mentioned an ablation. The reason I didn’t bring it up is because OP is young. Also if there is an underlying issue (like thyroid dysfunction) that should be treated first. Alternatively if OP was 100% positive she never wanted kids then an ablation (Or a hysterectomy) could be reasonable. Those would be the most drastic, expensive, invasive, and permanent options however.

Edit2: also just want to make sure people reading this aren’t horrified of IUDs. Like anything in life, some risk is associated with every option. This being said, most women love their IUDs.",476,0,
95,Comment,gu7xwt,HELP! Abnormal Menstrual Bleeding,thisguyknowsitall17,Physician,2020-06-01 02:30:19,"My advice (obgyn)
Thanks for the history. It’s super helpful. 
I have a couple of suggestions. First, ensure you don’t have any lightheaded ness, dizziness, or feel as if your going to pass out when your up and moving about. This would be an easy sign that the degree of anemia you have requires hospital attention. Second, a good rule of thumb is if your soaking a super pad every 30 minutes for more than 4 hours, that’s too much. 
Your obgyn during your hysteroscopy may not have resected  the 4 cm fibroid - they don’t grow that rapidly unless in very rare cases of certain types of cancer (I don’t suspect this in the least). Sometimes, fibroids are just beneath the surface of the inner lining of the uterus, and this is often the source of bleeding. The ultrasound you had previously often picks up the location of fibroids, and your obgyn would have seen this at the time of your hysteroscopy. 

You may require high doses of estrogen in order to slow the bleeding, or high doses of progesterone with a taper. Depending on the severity, this can be oral pills or intravenous.

Likewise, if bleeding is significant and doesn’t slow, you may require a D&C. I think it best to wait it out until your appointment unless you have the above symptoms. Checking a blood count tomorrow with your physician is probably a good idea, as well as a solidified plan to address the heavy bleeding.

We were living together and were exposed to mice at the time in our apartment.

February 2020: 
All above symptoms got intense for me in February. Saw colorectal surgeon and was referred to GI after my fissue didn't heal from diltiazem ointment and anal inflammation was still present. I started feeling full after eating, bloating, pain in abdomen, nauseated after eating, sometimes cramping while eating.

March 2020:
Gi saw inflammation in anus and fissure, ordered colonoscopy and endoscopy.

April 2020:

Biopsy reports are in album.
Chronic Inflammation found in esophagus, stomache, cecum, and rectum.

First opinion was gastritis and ulcerative proctitis.

2nd gi opinion was crohn's disease or indeterminate inflammatory bowel disease.

Both refused to let me see infectious disease specialist or test me for infections even though partner and I are having same symptoms.

Partner saw ENT because of pain in throat, ent find inflammation with no follow up.

Sends me to see his ""friend"" who is an infectious disease specialist.

I see infectious disease specialist a week later. He tells me there is no infection that would cause chronic inflammation.

He says it's a coincidence me and partner are sharing symptoms. 

June 2020:

Partner goes to GP, they find an ulcer in his throat and more inflammation.

I go to the ER because I'm desperate and want answers. I have stool studies sent.

I have results in album. 

July 2020:

I start seeing another GP #2 to get more opinions. She orders more stool studies.

Fecal Leukocytes are positive.

Partner gets more testing and tells me he is positive for CMV infection.

Symptoms (physical)

* Weight loss
* Tremors/shakiness
* Loss of bladder control

Symptoms (Mental)

* Spaciness (unaware of her surroundings, almost like she's going around in a daze)
* Forgetfulness
* Extreme sensitivity
* Regressive like thoughts/actions (I know of no other way to describe it.)

I am posting out of concern for my daughter. Over the past year or so, I have watched her maturity seemingly decrease. She was always young at heart in the sense that she enjoyed certain childish things, but wouldn't solely depend on these, and had interests that were more ""her age"". In the last few months, she has not only denounced some of her old hobbies/interests, but can't even seem to grasp or comprehend what she used to be able to. For example, she used to be a speedy, comprehensive reader, sometimes being able to finish a good 300-page book in a day or two. Now, she struggles to even move from page to page, and has to re-read the same sentence over and over again. This has greatly affected her college. Her speech has become simple, scattered almost. She tells me that she doesn't remember the bigger words, which are really just the everyday words people use. The way that she describes her thoughts is forced. It takes a lot for her to put together a sentence, and sometimes it makes no sense (Ex. She uses a word that has a different meaning than what she's trying to say). 

As far as her ability to care for herself goes, she is still pretty self-sufficient, but loses control of her bladder, when she used to always be in control of it before. Wets the bed sometimes (accidentally), and experiences a lot of leaks. Has started wanting to eat with her hands and drink exclusively out of straws/baby-like bottles (Water bottles that resemble that of a baby bottle where she only has to suck instead of sip/drink normally). Has become OBSESSED with stuffed animals and childlike items. This is very distressing for me as her mother to watch. It's like I'm watching my adult daughter go back to a childlike state. All of these things I have discovered throughout the months either unintentionally/accidentally, as she tries to do most of these in private. Some of these things such as her spaciness (especially regarding her school performance) she has told me herself, but I am now putting all of these symptoms together and starting to become worried. Is this a sign of some kind of neurological disorder? Could this be some other manifestation of her depression/anxiety? I've never heard of an adult regressing like this due to those illnesses, but I realize I am not very educated in mental illnesses or their effects. Please help me make sense of this, I feel like I'm slowly losing her.",710,126,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/l43nup/daughter_is_majorly_regressing_and_i_have_no_idea/

Because if nothing has been imaged, then it needs to.


If constipation has been confirmed, I would agree with  the other doc in trying frequent enemas for the next day.  With a mineral oil enema, you’d expect to have a large bowel movement in the next few hours (especially if doing it at 2 hour intervals).


If you don’t have luck with that, then I’d probably go to the ED tomorrow since you may need manual disimpaction.  It could unfortunately be the case that there could just be a large rock hard piece of stool in the distal rectum and no amount of enemas will take care of it and it will need to be manually removed (which will cause everything to flow out afterwards).


Obviously this isn’t the ideal, but somethings it’s the only treatment.  Additionally, after you get cleared out, you should follow-up with your doctor to explore why you became so constipated.  Unless you were taking a lot of opiods, it’s kind of odd for an adult to suddenly become constipated and need to disimpaction.  If unsure of the cause, a colonoscopy should definitely be considered.",448,0,

Two weeks ago I was holding him as he sobbed on the bathroom floor, and he told me he's giving this one more year. That he doesn't want to feel like this anymore. 

I'm watching him waste away. He says every day that he feels like a 90 year old man. Getting off the couch is tough for him most days. If he can find a bout of energy for a very small home workout, he's trashed for days after. He no longer does any of the things he used to love like hiking, biking, or working out at the gym. He can't walk the dogs, and can barely check the mail. He's surviving currently on turkey, fruit, and vegetables with basically no fat, because he feels sick if he eats anything else.  I am positively convinced he is dying, but I could never tell him that, because  my hope is the only thing keeping him going. I keep telling him he's going to be okay, that we will figure it out, but I just don't know anymore.

My husband began to feel ill just over 5 years ago. Since then his health has been in steady decline. 

Patient: 

40 year old male  
5'11  
Caucasian  
Previously a powerlifter  
Took a regular low dose (his words) of anabolic steroids for approximately 10 years, quitting cold turkey in 2015.   
Previously ate a TERRIBLE diet (carbo loading as part of workout regimen), but stopped that in 2015, and was also vegan for about a year in 2019. Currently eats very healthy- daily fruits/veggies, NO fast food, fried food, and little to no processed food. (what is processed is basically just grain free crackers)  
Appendectomy in 2015, first bout of pancreatitis the very next week.  
Childhood asthma which was resolved until 2017  
Allergy to Penicillin and amoxicillin (as told by his mother)  
One previous blood clot in leg (prior to 2013, but do not know the date or specifics)  
Recovering alcoholic who has not had alcohol since he was 21. (I am 100% positive he has had none since we met, but happy to explain further)  
Weight in 2015 was around 215 lbs, weight at beginning of decline in health was around 185, current weight around 155 lbs.  
Up to, and into 2017 he was working out (lifting-heavy) approximately 10 hours per week, now only an occasional light dumbbell workout at home.  
History of finicky sleep, but nothing like it is now  
Some history of bowel issues, which seem to occur and resolve repeatedly over years, and may not be related to a health problem.  
\[May or may not be related, but years ago he did develop a large white patch on his head seen here [https://imgur.com/a/jQInUur](https://imgur.com/a/jQInUur) although it does not seem to have changed since then, nor have others appeared\]

&#x200B;

  
Currently taking:

Occasional modafinil to help with brain fog for work, but he does not take a full dose, nor take it regularly.  
Coffee enemas daily (only thing that seems to help at all)

In the past he has taken a great many supplements and medications to try to find a cure for this illness. Those include Alpha blockers, trazadone, clonazepam, RLS medication (Can't recall the name) saw palmetto, bacopa, gotu kola, st. john's wart, valerian, melatonin, benadryl, probiotics, prebiotics, iodine, colloidal silver, vitamins (you name it he's probably tried it), passionflower, lemon balm, catnip, and chamomile. Certainly there are more.

He has tried dietary changes many times over the years also. He's been vegan, vegetarian, low fodmap, low amylose, paleo, and lectin free. He's done exclusionary diets many times, and we have not been able to pinpoint a cause that is specifically food related. (He does not do well with Cauliflower, Eggplant or avocado oil, though.)

**\[\[ BEGINS TO EXPERIENCE MOST SYMPTOMS FROM THIS DATE\]\]**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

In early 2017 my husband and I moved from New England, to New Mexico. 

The day before we moved, he found four embedded ticks on his thighs. We do not know how long they had been attached. (He was later tested for tickborne diseases, twice. Both were negative) 

In NM, we rented a home and beginning a few months after we moved in, he began to notice some strange symptoms, but nothing too alarming. 

His first biggest symptom was lack of sleep. He would wake up after a few hours, and not be able to get back to sleep. If he did manage, he'd still wake feeling very unrested in the morning. He felt very fatigued, and we attributed this to lack of sleep. 

His doctor ran tests but said he found no reason for his fatigue and sleeplessness, and referred him for a sleep study.   
He did diagnose him with an enlarged prostate, and some sort of bacterial infection of either the bladder or prostate (We cannot recall which) and put him on a long dose of CIPRO. He was taking that for quite a while (perhaps a month) when he began to notice his ankles hurting. At that time, the doctor took him off of CIPRO. I believe he replaced it with another antibiotic, and in total he was on an antibiotic for probably 3 months (as best we can recall).  
This same doctor's office also tried Alpha blockers (to stop nightmares?), clonazepam, trazadone, and a medication for restless leg syndrome.

&#x200B;

At the sleep study, he was incorrectly diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea. He used a CPAP nightly for close to a year before another sleep study  revealed the first diagnosis was incorrect, and he had no apnea (central, nor obstructive- we were at higher altitude)

He also saw a cardiologist during this time, due to him having heart palpitations.  They fitted him with a holter monitor. Due to an error in the office (we lived remotely and it was an issue with the cell carrier the monitors used) only about an hour of data was collected. They did say that the data showed no cause for concern, though.

He visited an ENT (thinking breathing problems may be causing sleep disturbances) and they ran a scope way up in his face. They told him he had roughly 90% blockage due to deviated septum. 

He had surgery to repair this, but it did not improve his symptoms.  
The end also ran a test for skin allergies, showing he was highly reactive to dust mites, but not much else from their test panel.

During this time my husband also militantly tried sleep hygiene (about 3 months) but it did not help.  
He also tried cutting screen time 3 hours before bed, as well as a cutoff for eating and drinking.

By 2020, his symptoms were documented as follows:

Insomnia  
Fatigue (extreme)  
Body aches  
Weakness  
Headaches, with sensitivity to light  
Memory impairment  
Difficulty concentrating/ brain fog  
Stiffness and joint pain  
Shortness of breath  
Heart palpitations  
Difficulty regulating body temperature  
Blurred vision  
Night sweats  
Mood swings  
Abdominal pain  
Vertigo  
Recurrance of childhood asthma

&#x200B;

We discovered that mold illness can cause most of these symptoms, and so found a doctor who specializes in mold and follows the Shoemaker protocol. He ran many tests, including a genetic test. He said roughly 25% of the population has a genetic problem that makes it so their bodies cannot rid themselves of mycotoxins, and that my husband was part of that group. (lab attached)

He prescribed clay binders, and moving. We did both.

We took a precious few belongings with us when we left, and then only hard items that could easily be cleaned. All soft goods like clothing, and pillows, etc were discarded.

  
After moving, most of the acute symptoms died down dramatically, leading us to believe this was the cause of his problems, and he would slowly improve over time, like his mold doctor said. 

He stopped experiencing the headaches and light sensitivity almost immediately, along with the stiffness and joint pain, blurred vision, night sweats, and the worst of the mood swings. He also stopped needing to use his inhaler daily.  However, now 3 years later, he has not improved further, and has developed other symptoms, and some existing ones are worsening.

In the beginning of 2021 we moved again, out of state. He visited another cardiologist, who did an EKG (although most of the leads were not touching his skin due to body hair they did not shave) for his heart palpitations, and said he was fine. They too fitted him for a holter for 24 hours. It took roughly 4 months to get the results, but they said there were no concerning findings.

&#x200B;

In 2022, his pancreatitis has flared up multiple times, and he has seen a few more doctors, including a GI. The GI has done many blood tests, and also did an endoscopic ultrasound. The findings were that there was minor flattening of the duodenum, but the doctor said (over the phone) that he saw no evidence of celiac disease, pancreatic, or stomach cancer or ulcers.   
The pancreatitis is now chronic, and most foods (unless they pretty much have zero fat, and still even then sometimes) cause him abdominal discomfort. He has pain in his stomach area, and into his back. This is often accompanied by abdominal bloating, belching, and passing gas. There are times when eating or drinking causes these symptoms, and other times where eating or drinking relieves them. It makes no sense.  


He also had an infected dental crown removed in early 2022, and was placed on antibiotics. He developed C-Diff, and was treated. The GI did a test to confirm it was gone, and told us that he needs to be taking a certain brand of both probiotics and fiber (benefiber, specifically), although he was already taking another brand of both.

We began to wonder about his previously infected dental crown. The dentist had removed that, and the tooth, and put in a bone graft. We started researching more on that, and found it plausible that he had other infection in his mouth which could be causing problems, perhaps having spread from the initial crown. We found a dentist who specializes in that type of thing. He had the bone graft removed, as well as another crown removed (which was also apparently infected) and they cleaned out (I think) two wisdom teeth cavitations. They sent in samples for testing. 

It's worth noting that he did not have this work done on the opposite side of his mouth, so if there is infection there somewhere we do not know.

We recently discovered we are able to order some tests ourselves through a third party, and have them processed at Labcorp or Quest. We tested for Lead poisoning, and toxoplasmosis. Lead because we do use cast iron, and occasionally antique ones, and they can have an unknown history in smelting. Toxoplasmosis because we got our first cat right around the time this all started in 2017. 

I messed up though: I saw it said to discontinue Biotin 72 hours prior to this test. He did not take anything called Biotin, and we thought nothing of it. However today, after getting these last results, I looked more into it. Turns out his B complex vitamins he's taking do have a high dose of Biotin (and apparently makes his urine bright yellow). Also, he began coffee enemas two days before these labs were drawn.  
 I understand that this may skew some results, but I'm including these anyway, just in case.

For the last year and a half we have been living in a brand new home (in yet another state), where we are the first occupants. We now believe that he is sensitive to mold, and it may have triggered something else, or allowed some other illness to take hold/run rampant. When he enters a place now that (probably) has mold, he begins to feel what he calls ""mold sweats"". IE acute symptoms immediately. Those symptoms resolve within a day of exiting the building.

&#x200B;

His daily symptoms now:

Extreme fatigue and lethargy  
Occasional heart palpitations  
Insomnia  
Malaise  
Tinnitus (developed early 2022)  
Chronic pancreatitis (or more accurately, stomach pain we associate with pancreatitis due to his previously diagnosis)

  
I tried to cover everything here, but I know I will have missed some things. I've pared it down as much as I can, but I am glad to provide any and all information I can get my hands on, if it will help in any way.

I know this has been a really long post, and if you're here at all, even if you scrolled straight to the bottom, I appreciate you. I am looking for ideas, direction, even just your curiosity. We have nothing else to lose at this point. I need to find a way to save his life. He's my whole world, my best friend, and I can't make it without him. I hope someone here has some ideas where we should go next, because I don't know what else to do but post on reddit.

/*---------------------------ORIGINAL POST---------------------------*/

Hey folks!

I taught a programming bootcamp for some folks in papua new guinea. it was remote, and I'm still stateside. I've stayed in contact with many of the students, and occasionally I'll see their posts on linkedin.

The health infrastructure on the island is not the best, and it seems that a connection of one of my student's is in a tricky spot. Their child's right eye has swollen, and the cornea looks almost calloused over. Apparently, there aren't any specialists available to treat it. Here's the post:

https://www.linkedin.com/posts/amos-steven-b9b92b1b3_medical-hospital-help-activity-6901102095534288896-1zwt

Is there any way we can support them? What kind of specialist would this require, and would it be possible to diagnose/treat remotely?

Apologies, I don't have any of kid's info, but given that I'm trying to connect them with care rather than diagnose, hopefully you won't mind if I try to bamboozle the bot so we can get this posted.

I need to determine if I should pay for a private autopsy, the problem is money is tight. However, if it's likely someone messed up, I want to take action. This hospital has something of a reputation when it comes to problems with infections, and previously they messed up on a friend of mine, their mistake nearly led to the amputation of her arm. Luckily that time they caught their mistake, and the $250,000 medical bill wasn't placed on my friend.

Rough timeline:

* Day 1 he went to the ER for an infected toe. They referred him to another ER because the infection had spread to the bone and they needed to amputate. His GP said he had no diabetes. He may have had a case of bronchitis.

* Day 2 he's dealing with bad conditions at the hospital where his surgery will take place due to overcrowding in the non-covid section of the hospital while they give him antibiotics prior to surgery.

* Day 3 surgery takes place, surgeon reports everything went quickly and smoothly. Dad texts me after, saying everything went well. I talked with him and he sounded tired, but didn't seem out of the ordinary post-op.

* ~14 hours later, a nurse says he was talking with my dad, he was joking with the nurse and the nurse ""got his pain level down"" and continued his rounds. An hour after this, my dad starts to gasp for breath, starts coding and they move him to the cardiology section where he passed.

Some possible weirdness:

The surgeon led me to believe there would be an autopsy, though he never directly stated there would be one, as he said my dad was relatively young and the surgeon didn't know what could have gone wrong. However, the surgeon had either already signed off on no-autopsy or did shortly thereafter. Going back to our conversation, the surgeon never said ""there will be an autopsy"" he just said ""the coroner will have to tell us what happened"" or something along those lines.

I waited for a couple of days to hear back the results, but the hospital then lost my dad and the stuff he had brought in with him, they lost him for something like 4 or 5 days, with us calling every day after the 2nd day after his passing trying to find him and his phone so we could get his contacts and notify people. We still don't have his phone, so we haven't been able to notify all of his friends as the majority of their contact info is in his phone and we don't have it yet.",654,84,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/sr40np/did_medical_staff_mess_up_and_kill_my_dad_he_went/

All the following assumes you live in the US: 

I believe the specifics varies by state/county, but any unexpected death (with or without surgery) is by default a coroner's case.   This means, someone at the hospital (doctor or nurse) is legally obligated to call the county coroner and report the death.  The coroner has the discretion to order an autopsy, i.e. say yes or no they believe one should be done.  In this situation, I would think they definitely would, and the body would be transferred to the coroner's office to do it.  Even if the coroner says no, they don't require one, the attending doc of the patient can request an autopsy (to be done by the hospital.)

I guess in your shoes I would do the following:   
Contact the surgeon and ask if the case was reported to the coroner.  If not, why not.  If they did call, what did they say about an autopsy.     

Then ask how you go about arranging a private autopsy.  The surgeon might not know, but should be able to get you in contact with people in the hospital who can help you find out.   

Any respectable surgeon would want to know what happened just as much as you do.    If you find him being evasive on the subject or refusing to return your calls, contact the hospital administration.  Admins know medical legal risk and this is absolutely a red flag in that regard.",653,0,

edit- I would like to say one more thing and that is, some 3 years ago I had ultrasound of my belly, they sad I have some type of intestinal infections, due to financial reasons I could not continue my medications of that infection. So I pretty much ignored it. 

I also get constant red colored swelling on my tongue and area around it. Like mouth ulcer but not pimples like bumps on it, it's just constant swelling because of it sometimes even water stings while drinking.

I also get very very sharp pain on the right side of my stomach for like 2-3 seconds , which stops my body completely. but after 2-3 seconds maximum being 5-7 seconds things go back on as usual.

I broke my sacrum after I crashed my bike in August last year. I was not operated on, the surgeon said it's risky and its better to let it heal. But ever since the accident I lost control of my bladder and it hasn't gotten better. I have several accidents a day and my life is ruined. 

I got referred to the urologist and they put a camera in my bladder because they thought the bladder had been damaged. 

They told me to catheterize but that was extreme painful and i even got a infection. 

I've been managing this by staying home to avoid accidents (only good covid has brought me. I have an excuse to stay home). But even at home I feel the pressure in my bladder, I run to the bathroom but on the way there I leak and I can't clench to stop it. 

Please tell me if you have any solution to this. I can't live like this.

Have you had a any follow up with your surgical team? 

Did you have a spinal MRI at the time of your crash; do you know the results and has it been repeated? 

Have you had any change to these symptoms? Is it getting better/worse? Do you have any other urological symptoms like burning? 

At the time of your crash (and now) did you have any neurological symptoms? Like numb areas or weakness in your legs? 

When you have an accident, do you feel the need to pass urine and you just don’t make it in time? Or do you have any accidents where you didn’t realise you needed to pass urine until the accident had already happened?",494,0,

It is an external cath that applies like a condom and can help reduce the infection rate. 

Also, there are pretty sleak options for underwear that act like dipers to absorb leakage. If you are comfortable looking into period underwear I would recommend it. They are reusable and absorbant and come in all shapes from boxer breifs to whitey tighties. I know some people have a problem with crossing clothing gender lines but they truly are sleak and might be an interesting option depending on your needs. 
EDIT: I saw that there are some good underwear designed for people who have incontinence as well! Pretty neat! 

If you have not discussed going to pelvic floor physical therapy it might be an option. Depending on the true severity of your injury that not be an option but it could not hurt to ask.

136,Post,mrdb9p,Infant with multiple medical conditions and CPS involvement.,sirSkillzAhlot,Layperson/not verified as healthcare professional.,1618488595.0,"This case involves my daughter and granddaughter. This case is very complicated, so this will be an extensive post.  

We found out that granddaughter had bilateral clubfoot during my daughters 2nd trimester scans.  Within the next week we went to OU Children’s hospital for additional scans and consultation with a pediatric orthopedic surgeon to get the diagnosis confirmed.  Which it was.  We immediately went into research mode and started gathering as much information as possible, and we joined a support group.  We started putting together a treatment plan with recommendations from our support group as well as information from the our Dr’s.  

Now, this is where everything gets complicated.  My daughters OB called a couple of weeks later with some upsetting news.  My daughter is Rh negative, which the OB knew about and this was her 2nd pregnancy, also something she knew, but she had failed to give her the rohgam shot, so she became sensitized.  This condition obviously took precedence.  We had to go weekly appointments to make sure baby wasn’t developing hydrops, which thankfully she did not.  However, when she was born she developed hemolytic disease/hemolysis hyperbilirubinemia and she was admitted into the NICU for 3 weeks and had 5 blood transfusions.  Her highest billi level was 23, but they held off on doing the blood tranfer/exchange because of the significant risk of brain damage that occurs with that procedure.  However, we were informed of the damage already caused by her high billi levels as well as the damaged caused by the RH disease.  This list included Cerebral Palsy.  Of course this realization that there were going to be some cognitive and/or developmental disabilities was devastating news for all of us, but we did what we do and went into research mode.  

Back to the clubfoot.  Normally babies with clubfoot are evaluated and treated within the first few days of birth, but that wasn’t an option for us.  She didn’t get her first evaluation until she was 6 weeks old.  She was referred to Scottish Rite in Frisco TX.  We took her there for her first 6 castings.  We decided to seek a second opinion when the Dr wanted to do the tendonectomy  and we just didn’t think her feet looked right.  When then went to Shriners in Shreveport.  One Dr at Shriners examined her feet and agreed that she was not ready for the tendonectomy and she needed more casting.  Another Dr also evaluated her and wanted a neurological referral because she thought that her clubfoot could be cause by a neurological condition.  So, the first Dr said that he suggested that we continue casting until we went to the neurologist, so we complied and she got 4 more casts with them.  After the last casting, which was Dec 28, she started having uncontrolled spasms and stiffness in her joints and muscles.  This cause her casts to slip so far that you could no longer see her toes, since it was a holiday weekend and they were closed, we were told to soak the casts off in the tub.  This was her last set of casts.  

In the next few weeks her spasms and stiffness were becoming more worrisome so went back to the children’s hospital for an MRI to rule out seizures or brain malformation that could be causing these issues.  While they said her brain was “clear” they did find a cyst at the base of her spine, but they just said we need to keep an eye on it.  They gave a diagnosis of hypertonic dystonia and we made an appointment to follow up with neurology.  With this diagnosis we were concerned with casting causing more harm than good, so we asked if delaying casting until we could figure out how to control her spasms was a good idea and the hospital pediatrician agreed that would be prudent.  We contacted Shriners to let them know that we would be delaying her casting and the nurse my daughter spoke with seemed to be in agreement.

She also has GI issues and vomits constantly, however they did rule out reflux and sandifers syndrome, but told us to follow up with a gastro specialist, which we are.  This brings us to February when the baby started spiting up blood in her vomit, so we took her to the local podunk ER, and they told us not to worry because they thought it was just burst capillaries from excessive vomiting.  The next day she started gushing blood from her mouth and was air flighted to the children’s hospital.  This is where shit starts to hit the fan.  The bleeding had stopped by the time they had arrived and her mouth and lips were swollen.  They got a CAT scan to rule out a GI bleed, which they did.  However, during this scan they noticed something odd in her femur, so they did some more X-rays of just her upper legs and knees.  They found what appeared to be healed fractures in both of her femurs, but there was no definite fracture line, and what appeared to be buckle fractures in both knees.  This, of course, got CPS involved.  The blood from her mouth turned out to be a clump of blood vessels under her tongue that had burst.  She did have a tongue tie and lip tie clipped before she went to the NICU and they think it may have had something to do with that.  The fractures were a mystery, but we thought that maybe improper casting could have something to do with it.  She had a follow up with radiology at the children’s hospital where X-rays were taken.  Then about a week later we went back to Shriners to get an evaluation and more X-rays. During this visit we asked for X-rays of her lower legs as well because one of them seemed to be bothering her.  They found that she had a fracture in one of her tibias.  Since she had not had casting in two months we didn’t think that what was causing this fracture, but they said they we needed to test for metabolic bone disorders and osteogenesis imperfecta.  We have an appointment for genetic testing in July.  But we remembered that when she got her X-rays done at the children’s hospital the tech took the leg with the fracture and pulled really hard to straighten out her foot and pushed it between two blocks for the X-ray.  We had to tell the tech that she had clubfoot and couldn’t be straightened out.  Of course the baby was upset the whole time, but after she did that she began screaming and was inconsolable.  But there were no X-rays of her lower legs before she did this, so we don’t have anything to compare.  We mentioned this to the dr at Shriners and the pediatrician, but they both discounted this and said that they were sure that she knew how to do her job.  

After CPS became involved it seemed as if the care dramatically changed, how we were treated not only by the hospital, but also by our pediatrician.  They also started to focus on her growth and weight and diagnosed her with failure to thrive because she is in the 1st percentile.  However, this was never an issue or brought up by the pediatrician before CPS got involved.  She looks healthy and chubby, just very small.  She does have feeding issues which is why we are seeing a specialist.  Now we have weekly weigh ins to make sure she’s gaining weight, which she is.  She’s been gaining around 3-4 ounces a week, however her length hasn’t  changed much since she was born. 

On to the CPS investigation.  There was absolutely no evidence to support abuse, so they changed their investigation to medical neglect.  We found this ridiculous with as many appointments as we go to on a weekly basis, how could we possibly be neglecting this child’s medical needs?  Not only does she see her pediatrician weekly, but she also goes to physical therapy weekly.  We have specialist appointments set, but they are several months out because that’s just par for the course.  After several, extremely tense, conference calls with CPS investigators they substantiated the medical neglect claim based on the opinion of the DHS nurse.  When asked what constituted medical neglect for this case was 1.  She had switched PCP’s too often.  Which we gave valid reasons for each. 2. She was not getting her clubfoot treatment. (We had decided to delay, but we were still planning on treatment) 3. We failed to take her to a follow up appointment. (Only because the Dr had not sent a referral). 4. We failed to pick up medication after her hospitalization. Not only had she be given her dose for that day at the hospital, it was a compound that needed refrigeration and we had a 4 1/2 hour drive home, so we picked it up the following day at our local pharmacy.  5. She wasn’t confidant we knew how to mix formula properly.  She’s a breast fed baby, but since the drs wanted her to gain weight we were giving her 2oz of formula every 2 hours for extra calories.  There was some confusion with how we were mixing because the pediatrician relayed information wrong to the nurse.  But that was her made her decision it was medical neglect.  None of the investigators agreed with her decision, but the supervisor said that since she was the only medical professional he defaulted to her decision.  We have told by the social workers that we need to appeal.  

On to today, we had our weekly appointment with the pediatrician, which has very tense since the CPS investigation.  Both of the children were there because we have been very sick the past few weeks and my grandson started throwing up this morning and we wanted him seen at the same time, so we rescheduled for an afternoon appointment because she only sees sick patients in the afternoon. Right off the bat she comes in and starts ranting about how she’s frustrated with us because we haven’t taken the baby back to get casted and that we’re not taking care of her needs and how she feels like we’re DR shopping and we reiterated that she’s had 10 castings, so it’s not like we’ve been neglecting her feet.  She tells us that she doesn’t have those records so she can’t be sure we’ve done those castings.  We said well you should have them because we signed a waiver for you to get them, so you should have them.  She said it was our responsibility to get those records for her.  Then she tells us that she got the records from my daughters OB, which are pursing a lawsuit against, and she did not give her permission to get those records.  So how could she records from a dr that we did not give permission for, but not have the we did.  Things got heated and we called the social worker in to mediate.  She changed her demeanor when the social worker was there, but she was giving her inaccurate information and every time we would rebuff what she said, she said we were being argumentative and basically saying we were acting like know it all’s because we were questioning her and correcting wrong information.  There were several times she flat out lied to her.  We’ve been sick and she has treated the kids for it, giving them antibiotics, so we couldn’t go back to Shriners because they would turn us away if any of us had a temp.  But she lied to the social worker and said they don’t screen before appointments. We have also made plans to see Dr. Dobbs in Florida because he’s the leading expert for clubfoot in the states, and comes highly recommended by people in our support group.  She does not like this at all and contends he’s a quack because he doesn’t accept Medicaid.  So, now she has convinced the social worker that if we don’t get her casting right away we are neglecting her feet and causing more problems for her.  We can’t get out to Florida until the end of May because we have appointments for specialists between now and then.  But the pediatrician is adamant that we get her casted at Shriners.  We were at that appointment for 3 1/2 hours, yet she never examined the sick child or even asked about his well being.  

We are at a loss.  Our entire life is wrapped around getting baby adequate medical attention, but it just seems like we’re being persecuted from every angle. I’m sorry it was such a loooooong post, but I’m just trying to give all of the info I can.  I also feel like the records don’t do this case justice either, because they’re either too vague, incorrect or simply inaccurate, but every time I question the records I get blow back.  Please, please, please someone help us navigate this complicated road.  We’re drowning here.",649,88,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/mrdb9p/infant_with_multiple_medical_conditions_and_cps/

Hey, so, the docs over here are absolutely pissing me off. I am having some serious issues and every time I come in, they keep writing it off as me being overweight. 

The kicker? I only fluctuate between 120-130 lbs. My doctors have all been male. I'm not sure what else I am supposed to do so I thought I'd come here to see either what people think is wrong with me, ways to handle my symptoms, or both. 

I'm not really sure how to go about this, but I guess I'll start with what I already know and was diagnosed with before recent situations. I've got ovarian cysts, anemia when on periods or three days before, I have mono relapses at least once every two years, have had a concussion within the last two years, am lactose intolerant, and I used to take medicine for hypo(hyper? Can't remember which)thyroid until bloodwork came back with it gone. I'm also diagnosed with depression, ADD, and PTSD. There's a possibility of any of my symptoms having to do with either of those, but I'm positive ""overweight"" isn't the issue. 

Within the past year and a half (started before COVID), I've been dealing with dizzy spells and fainting spells, each one with terrible nausea that almost always ends up with me throwing up. I get a sharp pain behind my left eye right before each and I get a hot wash over me and my ears ring like crazy. If I am even slightly warmer than comfortable, I feel like I am going to pass out. A friend said that during this, even though my vision is black to me, she said my eyes sometimes stay open and my skin gets cold and clammy. The fainting spells can last anywhere from 1-6 minutes and then I throw up and feel a bit better. 

Not as often but generally in the same time frame, I get abdominal pain on my left side not unlike a cyst popping but it's too high for the ovary. It can get hard to breathe at times and sometimes I feel like, when I'm about to faint, my heart flutters and it forces me to cough. 

I have a swollen lymph node under my right arm that keeps getting brushed off as a byproduct of my frequent cases of mono, but it hurts even when I'm not ill with it. I don't know if that's normal with mono.

My diet is pretty mixed, generally only eating fast food when I've had to stay late to work and wouldn't feel like cooking when I get home. I'm not the healthiest eater,, but I do love fruits and bellpeppers so I eat them pretty often. I prefer flavored water (not sparkling) and have a Moutain Dew maybe three times a week or when I'm out with friends. 

Exercise wise, I mainly take walks but if it's hot outside or if I get too worked up, I pass out so I don't do it as often as I probably should. 

I don't smoke but have had second hand since I was a baby. I only drink alcohol socially so at the most 3 times a month. I don't smoke weed, but I have had Delta 8/9 tinctures. 

I don't know how much of this is connected, or if any of it is even connected, but I keep passing out at work and no doctor is listening to me. I'm really scared at this point and feel like I can't get any help.

Edit:// I was writing stream of thought and forgot to mention that I get extremely thirsty after throwing up. Also, I can feel there's a difference between anemia fainting and whatever this is. The anemia just feels more dizzy and tired, like I just need to sit down. Whatever this is feels like a build up of hot pressure in my skull.

2nd Edit:// To mass answer a couple of comments about weight, I am wide set bone wise. My shoulders and hips are wider than average for women and it's not fat, I have a hard time finding women's shirts that fit my shoulders. I'm also pretty sure a good chunk of my weight is literally just breast mass. I am planning on getting a reduction on that end. I don't think that is why they would call me overweight but it's a possibility?",641,163,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/nlznu1/docs_keep_diagnosing_me_overweight_for_the/

145,Post,o3fq2d,Anorectal concerns after being anally assaulted? Please help.,pprobablyneedtherapy,Layperson/not verified as healthcare professional,1624108007.0,"23F. So I was raped and sodomised repeatedly 2 weeks ago. It had been for a consensual hookup with boundaries set. He wanted to start anally, and it was okay for maybe the first 2–5 mins — I know that my anal laceration was probably from when he first stuffed it in. But when he started going really deep (I think he was 8 inches in length, if he wasn’t lying, and his girth was quite huge too) and it started to hit a ‘wall’ of sorts somewhere deep inside my rectum / pelvic area, and I told him it hurt and tried to push him off and started to cry involuntarily from the pain, he held me down and penetrated me more forcefully, faster and deeper on purpose to make me cry even harder because it aroused him. 

The entire ordeal lasted 2 hours, where he started vigorously and roughly sodomising me at the start for about 5–10 mins, and again a second time towards the end (also with force, he was also choking / strangling me but not enough to die, just enough to get extremely disoriented) for about what felt like 15–20 mins. There were other stuff in between, including really painful vaginal sex while I was completely restrained. At the end of everything, the bedsheets looked at least 35% stained by a bit of fresh blood, more dried and diluted blood, some pink-whitish clumps of squishy flesh, and some pale yellow-orange hued rectal discharge — [something like this (some hotel review pic)](https://images.app.goo.gl/kMhQanMyV9V3qjfM9) but with more colours and more coverage.

Anyway I did do a medical exam 8 days after the assault so not much injuries were seen. Just abrasions to the posterior fourchette, a 3–5mm anal laceration and abrasions, and I told them that I also had a neck sprain. I didn’t manage to ask them about this question here, so hope you guys can help.

My anus feels swollen, as if it’s almost (if not already) completely closed shut over multiple layers. I’ve tried to put lidocaine ointment along my anal canal for the laceration using a finger but that has been difficult, like it’s too tight and hard to navigate an opening. I’ve been having difficulties passing gas too, and also having bowel movements. It feels like an obstruction is blocking the exit. I was having rectal discharge (clear / milky / yellow-gold — probably his semen) alongside a bit of blood for the first few days, instead of passing gas or having bowel movements. I don’t have discharge anymore (I think) but passing gas and bowel movements are still an issue. I’m either only managing to poop pebbles, or awful diarrhea, but maybe that’s also just my chronic constipation and not eating enough. I just always feel like there’s something more to let out. Sometimes this causes issues with my bladder where I keep having remaining bits of pee after standing for a few minutes (not UTI).

One more comparably prominent issue is that I feel like I can’t feel or control my anal / bowel muscles anymore? I can push and strain from my lower abdomen, but I feel no strength in the rectal area. The closing/opening and pushing-out reflexes aren’t there anymore.

Does anyone know what’s up and can advise? I’m not sure if it’s just me mentally psyching myself out because I fear the sensation of pain deep in there again. But yeah, I will go get a physical examination done by a GP if you feel like it’s necessary. Thanks in advance.

Unfortunately the stuff you uploaded is all out of order and very incomplete.

Trying to organize the stuff you posted (I'm typing out long date formats because the American specialty of MM/DD/YYYY is very confusing to me):

* [The first link](https://imgur.com/a/NOWznqc) loads results from an FDG-PET/CT without showing any date, that refers to an older CT made 13th of August 2022 for comparison. The report describes bulky cervical cancer local recurrence plus some small lymph node metastases in the pelvis and paraaortic. This must be a fairly recent scan.

* [The second link](https://imgur.com/a/7DuKE84) loads CT results dated 30th of November 2022 that's compared to an older CT from 30th of October 2022. Very good primary tumor remission is described, but also stable suspect lymph nodes and new peritoneal thickening and nodes that could be peritoneal carcinomatosis.

* [The third link](https://imgur.com/a/uOIBCTL) loads CT results dated 10th of September 2022 that's compared to an older CT from 4th of September 2022. The radiologist describes new bilateral uretral stent insertion and no change in small lymph node metastases and 7.6 x 6.0 cm cervical carcinoma.

* The fourth link is the same as the third.

* [The fifth link](https://imgur.com/a/QS4SZFP) loads the newest CT results dated 4th of December 2022 that's compared to an older CT from 3rd of November 2022. There's new fluid in the pelvis, DD abscess DD ascites. Circumferential wall thickening of the rectosigmoid ""likely on the basis of radiation colitis"" is described. CT morphology remains concerning for peritoneal carcinosis (which is hard to see and easy to miss on CT).

* [The sixth link](https://imgur.com/a/9oWSPcZ) describes attempted pelvic / ascites fluid drainage on 5th of December 2022. Unfortunately it didn't succeed, the fluid shifted too much while you moved and before they met it with the needle the procedure had to be stopped because you couldn't tolerate the pain. The goal was to find out what the cause is: Abscess or sterile inflammation or peritoneal carcinomatosis. They recommended another procedure to find out, by trying to get a biopsy of an omental nodule.

* [The seventh link](https://imgur.com/a/uoWKN47) loads some labs that are not very interesting here and again the CT results dated 4th of December 2022 that's compared to an older CT from 3rd of November 2022 (same as fifth link).

* [The eighth link](https://imgur.com/a/2ckTHFP) loads some labs that are not very interesting here.

I never thought I'd come to this moment but, my younger brother (5 years and 4 months old) was discovered with a pretty big brain tumor... He already has difficulties in walking and standing still etc... 

He is a perfectly healthy boy, he never had any kind of issues until suddenly, in the duration of 6 hours everything fell apart... 

The tumor is located in the brain stem so removing it via surgery or chemotherapy is impossible as it might leave him completely disabled or even kill him... According to the words of the doctor
Since I wasn't in direct contact with the doctor, and I thought asking here might be better since it has a larger exposure and larger variety of people who can answer this... I wanted to ask few questions, what are the all possible solutions to this? Can something ELSE be done other than radiation? And if no, what is the success rate for curing (stopping or even making smaller) the tumor itself via radiation therapy? If it will be cured, what are the chances that the tumor will start growing again after some period of time? And how deadly is it after it was ""cured""? The doctor even said that things might even get out of control and he might even pass away during the next few days, he didn't say what were the chances though so can somebody please please please tell me that the chances of this happening are small? + I just want everything to go back to normal, play with him and just make everything fine again like it was just 3-4 days ago... Is this possible or his life is now changed, forever? In what ways? 

Please take this seriously, I really care for him, I am writing this with tears since I am deeply scared for him and what he might go through... I know that this subject is very serious and it's not some kind of ordinary virus... Thank you all in advance...! 

Ps.

I have a genetic mutation called GCK-MODY which is kind of like lifelong prediabetes. The nice thing about it is that it doesn't require treatment, it doesn't lead to the usual complications associated with Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes, and my risk for developing other types of diabetes are the same as the general population. 

But damn, I wish I'd never been diagnosed with this. The problem is that every caregiver I encounter sees ""diabetes"" and thinks they know what that means. This mutation is rare enough that unfortunately, I am often a bit more informed than my doctors and nurses about the condition. I try to let them know I don't need counseling about nutrition and exercise, but I always seem to be put on the diabetes ""conveyor belt"" of treatment. This is extra unpleasant because I'm recovering from body image issues and disordered eating, so I can have irrational reactions to things said in these discussions. 

I understand this might sound like I'm ignoring some good advice, so I'll just put this out there that my A1c has been steady at 6.0 for the last six years, I have a healthy diet, and exercise 30-90 minutes six days a week. 

So it's infuriating for EVERY appointment, even with dentists and dermatologists and eye doctors, to start with a check in about how I'm managing my diabetes. I get my health care through a big organization with a central chart database, so every provider no matter what specialty sees ""diabetes"" before they even see my face. I had one obgyn say she would only manage my prenatal care if I agreed to an elective c-section, which is LUDICROUS even though pregnancy is the only time GCK-MODY might impact healthcare protocols.

When I try to explain about the condition, they might seem to listen to me, but then they'll conclude the conversation with a tip about limiting carbs and getting enough exercise, or a mention of what complications I can expect from poorly managed diabetes. It's depressing and irrelevant. 

So docs of Reddit, could you give me some magic words that will nudge medical professionals off the ""diabetes track"" and into care that's appropriate for me?

And by the way thank you so much for the hard work you do to keep people healthy. I really look up to medical professionals regardless of this complaint.",627,136,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/gjtk1m/how_can_i_get_doctors_to_ignore_my_medical/

Before I start to describe what happened that day, I want you to know that English is not my native language and I'm from third world country, so there is one hospital that is far and does not have the best doctor or nurse in town. And they don't what happened to her either that why I want to ask someone who is know about medical.

My cousin is only 15 year old and was not sick or have any problem before she suddenly passed away a few days ago. She and I are childhood best friend, that day we went to forest to get water and farming in the morning, it was hot like any other day. But when we are done and went back home together at that evening. She stopped on half way and I looked at her, she was bleeding from her nose and mouth to the point she didn't have any strength to walk anymore more like faint. I was scared and panicked that I have to carry her on my back even though I'm only 16 year old. The road is not clear path or smooth since there's downhill and rock. I did my best and try to get her back home as fast as I could that day, but when we drive her to hospital. She couldn't be save and died at 9 pm on the same day. If is it food, then why am I'm not sick like her. I was sad and confused want to know the answer but the doctor he doesn't know either. We eat the same thing, she did eat anything different. I remember that day clearly and still have the shirt she bleeding on. I'm still think is too fast and suddenly for me to accept that she passed away, I also frustrated not know the cause and exactly happened to her.

Please someone who might know this help me explain what the cause suddenly.



Update 04/19/24: Today is her funeral and I want to write to sharing with you guys since I posted here although I was hope I will get the answer I want to know the truth of her death because she is like a sister to me. I cried a lot and I was mad at the doctor could not explain to me in the hospital. That is why I posted here even though my English is not good when you read my writing. Now I know that I will never get to know the truth and what happened to her in the end. I'm embarrassing to say that I realize it hard for me to understand sometimes based on my education and background. I wish I was born into more city with better education. When I read comments, I realized that you guys live a different life than our lives. Maybe because we're different or I'm only turning 16 year old who is still immature. But I will pray to God if there is really next life I hope she and I can be best friends longer than this life in a better place. So, we can keep the promises and dreams that she and I plan to do when we turn into adults together. Since we can't keep our promises in this life,  I really hope in another life we can fulfill our promises together. And one last thing, I hope nobody will ever experience it like I did.

Need urgent help. Parent dying alone with no help.   
My parent is in Ukraine and I can't legally or physically reach her as I'm russian. She is 80 and has always had chronic pain due to salt deposits and hernias in her spine. It has got too bad for her to cope recently. The pain is terrible. She is in warzone and has no access to doctors or meds. She is immobile and refusing to spend even 2,5 hours in a car/bus to make it to the nearest city since the pain is that severe. Unable to sleep for more than 2 hours. I have 3 questions: 1)she asked me is it possible to painlessly go away since she has 6 ampules of morphine since her recent husband's passing. What it will be like? There is nobody in this world that I love more than her, I am terribly scared, sorry. 2)If I manage to find a steady supply of drugs more potent than she has always taken, like morphine – is it a 1 way ticket? The tolerance goes up and she will need more and more every month? How long can she last on such meds? 3) If by some miracle I manage to get her in some hospital, is there anything that could be done to support her life for some years more?     
  I will be very greatful for help and willing to send money for advice or counceling.",616,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/y3r4uq/need_urgent_help_parent_dying_alone_with_no_help/

Before I give my answer, I must say, patients should be counselled by a doctor before such a decision is made, to make sure this is a decision made by a competent person and not one affected by the current impaired mental status of the patient (like for example in suicidal patients or those who are severely mentally handicapped).

&#x200B;

How many grams of morphine is in each amp? Could you ask her to take a picture?

If I understood your question correctly, she wants to try to overdose on morphine. Let me tell you, there is no certainty that any dose of morphine would kill her. The drugs usually used for such things (where it is legal) are a cocktail of medications, some for pain, some for calming the patient down and sedating, and some for relaxing the muscles. Also, it is usually done in a controlled environment where there is medical staff to make sure it happens and that she is comfortable, I would not recommend doing it on her own.

My advice, as another physician commented, is to use the morphine to lessen her pain until she can make it to another nearby hospital.

In terms of potency of morphine, I will not answer here, please feel free to send me a DM if you want to discuss this further as I don't think this semi-public is an appropriate place to discuss such matters.",386,0,
175,Comment,y3r4uq,Need urgent help. Parent dying alone with no help.,squidgemobile,Physician - Family Medicine,2022-10-14 11:25:18,"1. Rather than use the morphine to die, why doesn't she take a small amount to control the pain long enough to go to the nearest city?   
2. Not every month, but opioids do need to be adjusted periodically. She would need access to a regular doctor then though.   
3. Depends entirely on her health conditions. This pain is terrible but if it's arthritis and herniated disks, it won't kill her. The goal is to just control the pain so her quality of life improves.

Please help.",kokkica,Layperson/not verified as healthcare professional,1688142222.0,"My friend's brother just had a baby several days ago. The mom is in her mid 30s, third time mom, healthy. They have 2 completely healthy kids. The pregnancy was good, although the baby was born about a week after due date. The mom was in hospital during that period as she had contractions periodically but they said there wasn't a need to induce her. She delivered a (seemingly) healthy girl on june 27th (due date was june 19th).

While she was in hospital, everything seemed great. When my friend and her brother went to pick the mom and baby up from the hospital yesterday, the baby had a mild seizure while the nurses were doing the final check-up. However, it was dismissed and the baby was allowed to go.

Just mere hours after the baby got home, she had two more seizures in the span of 3 hours. The first was around 5pm and the second was around 8pm, after which they took the baby to the hospital. They ran some tests and decided to keep her for the night.

She had another seizure in the morning, a stronger one, and it was witnessed by a doctor. The doctor was pretty concerned and ordered some other tests. The brain scan and reflexes were good, brain activity was good. They decided to keep her anyway, just to keep an eye on her. 

The baby was finally seen by a neurologist this afternoon. The neurologist is an older woman, they say she's very experienced in neonatal care. She basically said that it's nothing, that it happens all the time, that the mom was probably hungry, cold and/or scared so she was shaking during delivery which somehow transfered the shakiness to the baby and it manifested as a seizure (3 days later?). Now, I'm absolutely NOT a doctor, much less an experienced neurologist, but this honestly smells like BS. I also don't have kids and have never given birth. 

Is this possible? My friend and her family are holding onto what this woman said and I definitely don't want to be skeptical, but I really can't help it. It just sounds so impossible to me and the fact that it happened 3 times in the 24 hours the baby was released just makes me believe that the hospital is trying to save itself from a lawsuit.

Can any doctor, nurse, mother, anyone who had or has heard of a similar experience tell me their opinion? Because I truly wish I could believe it, but I simply don't.

Neonates often need blood tests to make sure there's no hypoglycemia, hypocalcemia, inborn errors of metabolism, or infection. Some infants also need a lumbar puncture (to make sure there's no meningitis or some metabolic errors such as glycine encephalopathy). These tests will be ordered by a neonatologist/pediatric neurologist after a careful physical examination. If seizures are infrequent, recording them on cell phone is a good way for parents to show their doctor what these events look like. Obviously, ""shaking"" of the mom due to hunger/cold is not something that's going to transfer to the baby. There's probably something that was missing in the translation of the neurologist evaluation. There are dozens of common conditions that can cause neonatal seizures (true seizures), many rare ones, and many that look like seizures but are not...there are also some conditions such as ""benign familial neonatal seizures"" that may require additional evaluation. In summary, careful observation by trained people and a diagnostic workup (lab tests and imaging) is needed if there are really seizures, but sometimes they are not seizures.",230,0,

Sometimes my wife thinks I have symptoms of ADHD, autism, or schizophrenia, but I've only been tested for autism (four times as a kid) and according to the tests I don't have it. I was told I was an absolute terror as a child but grew out of it. 

---

My wife and I got into a pretty interesting discussion last night about my emotional state. We were laughing and joking around, I made a joke about how everyone walks around pretending they're in a hallmark movie, and we got into it a bit, and long story short it turns out I don't feel most emotions the way other people do. I've always been under the impression that there's a social contract that controls all human interaction, and everyone pretends to feel a certain way to act in accordance with this contract.

For a vast majority of my life, other people have seen me as heartless. I went to about four therapists as a kid (all of whom believed I'd be in prison by my 20s) and several other therapists as an adult who described me as 'unnerving, but harmless'. Two suggested I was probably schizophrenic or schizotypal. For the record I've never been sent to therapy, I asked to go to therapy when I was a kid because I felt different from my peers and I didn't know why, and my parents thought it couldn't hurt. 

I don't feel sad when people die, and I loved my dog with all my heart but also didn't feel sad when she died and didn't understand why anyone else was sad (same with all my mom's cats). I thought they were pretending. The way I saw it, I loved it when she was alive and we had a lot of great times, and I was sad that we wouldn't have any more good times, but on a biological level we're all animals and we all live and die, and the average large dog lives 14 years and ours lived for 16 so I was expecting it.

I didn't feel sad when my grandfather died and I don't miss him, which sent me into an existential crisis because everyone around me was in mourning. He and I were very close and when I tried to explain that he's probably happier wherever he is now (he was a blue collar guy who was miserable and bedridden for the last three years of his life) they got angry with me, which I thought was silly. My grandfather was a lot like me and we talked about this often: he didn't understand emotion and saw himself as more like a robot, and when he was no longer useful he wanted to die right then and there so as not to consume extra resources. It feels mean to say ""I felt happy when he died"" but I really did feel happy that he was no longer suffering because if I were trapped in a bed bored out of my mind and unable to do what I wanted, I'd want to die too. Similarly, when I'm living far away from family I don't miss them. I enjoy spending time with them when I'm with them, but my wife describes missing her family as a gnawing feeling that makes her cry, whereas I've never felt that myself and have no idea what that would feel like.

On the flip side, I don't do a lot of the typical 'sociopath things'. I don't manipulate people, I see all that 'survival of the fittest' stuff as macho posturing, I've never hurt an animal on purpose (or a person, for that matter), although I do feel pretty damn happy when someone who used to be mean to me dies of an overdose or in an accident. I'm not edgy and don't like making people upset, but if they're already upset I don't really care. I try to make them less upset because I know it's hurting them in the same way a broken bone or toothache would hurt me. Similarly, when my wife accidentally hurts someone's feelings or makes someone's life harder, she feels a deep sense of shame or guilt. I don't know what guilt/shame feels like and I don't understand it. Like, I'll feel bad if I step on a cat's tail by accident but I forget about it as soon as the cat does.

I try to be as kind as possible but sometimes I'll accidentally hurt someone because I don't really understand what will hurt someone because I don't understand what feeling hurt feels like. I just know that when I say something that drives people away, they won't spend time with me anymore and when no one spends time with me I get bored, so I have a long mental checklist of things not to say to people, as well as things I can do to make people happy, so they come around more often. I don't want to hurt anyone because then everyone will go away and I'll be alone. 

I've tried to feel empathy and I feel sad that I don't understand it because other peoples' lives look fun and interesting. Every couple of years I go back to therapy and the therapist always comes to the conclusion that I'm just wired differently and I'll never be able to understand that feeling. My wife says I just haven't found the right therapist. I'd like to be fixed, it's very lonely always feeling like everyone's in on something you're not.",614,144,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/eea4bq/real_talk_how_do_you_know_if_youre_a_sociopath_is/

**PRIMARY COMPLAINT:** Crippling Menstrual Symptoms

——

• Age: 17
• Sex: Female
• Height: 5'1

———

• I do not drink, smoke, or do any drugs
• I am not on any medication

• I am a virgin, but I do masturbate, however I always make sure my hands are clean and I do not keep my nails long 

———

• Recently cut artificial sugar from my diet in hopes of relief from symptoms from my approaching period however the pain and symptoms still came

• Have not consciously consumed animal products in about a year, with a few accidental slip-ups from packaged food

• I have had an ultrasound and they found nothing 

• I have had *urine tests and they have found nothing

• The pain comes a few days before my period and on the first day of my period and then it's gone

• My stool is not consistent. Sometimes I can't pass everything, most times when I do pass it is a really light brown color and it's not solid. Other times it is a regular brown color and only some solids. *(I'm sorry if this is grossing you out, I just want to give enough symptoms)*

• I take Midol sometimes, but I can not tell if the pills work, either they actually take an hour or two to kick in and they do in fact work or the pain just goes away. 

• No one else in my family has menstrual symptoms as bad as mine, they all say they can't relate to how bad my pain is or even throwing up

**BACKGROUND:**

It started in middle school and around the same time every month in gym class and I would get this really incredible stomach pain but I didn't have my period yet. It always felt like I had to go to the bathroom REALLY bad but when I would go there would be nothing to pass. 

Then I got my period some years later and at first it was not really painful, they were just mild cramps that I assumed everyone felt and these cramps just felt like normal pain that could be tolerated. 

**NOW W/ HORRIBLE SYMPTOMS:**

But then in high school it got much worse. 

• The **pain** is like nothing I've ever felt and I am scared every month. It is on the left side of my stomach, and it feels like someone is stabbing me from deep in my stomach. Sometimes the pain from the left stabs the right and sometimes the pain heats my entire body. *I sometimes feel like if I could just cut open my stomach I could just find the issue.*

• Sometimes I throw up, other times I am just really **nauseous**. The first day is easier if I do not eat for the whole day. I feel it is worth noting that one time I tried to break this rule of mine by eating a saltine cracker and in return my cramps intensified and my veins felt like they were being squeezed. 

• I have fallen asleep one time from how bad the pain was, but it was only once. Mostly, I am just very weak and it is best to stay in bed. 

The doctors say nothing is wrong, but these symptoms are insane and it's just hard to believe they are doing everything they can. I am afraid for my future, of having to call in sick every month to a job I care about because of these symptoms.

 You have endometriosis. Most likey anyway.

 If a period is debilitating it is not a bad period, something else is going on. 

Endometriosis is where the tissue that creates the lining of the womb spreads to places it shoudn't be. As the tissue expands and shrinks with your cycle it puts pressure and irritation to whatever it is against. Mainly it just causes heavy periods and painful cramps, but it can include other symptoms dependent on where it is located.

The ligaments of the womb - back ache
The bladder - UTI symptoms and occasionally blood in the urine
The bowel - diarrhoea/constipation, pain on passing stool, bleeding 
The ovaries/sides of the womb (adnexa) - leg pain, lower abdo pain (dull and achey)
The inner lining of your abdominal wall - sharp sudden pain, sometimes electrical like of it creates scar tissue
The muscle of the womb - severe cramping

It can go other places but these are the most common.

You also tend to also get severe bloating pre period with this conditiom.

 There are treatments and these start with contraceptives. Stopping your periods is the best way forward using progesterone pills as it stops the other tissue from growing as well. Sometimes you need more than this but it's a good start.

 If it settles with progesterone it is more than likely endometriosis. A laparoscopy (keyhole surgery) can be done to absolutely confirm it, but I've seen people with endometriosis who have had a clear laparoscopy but still have severe symptoms, and this is because the tissue can go anywhere, including deeper from the view of laparoscopy.

 It's a common, heavily underdiagnosed disease and early progesterone use can limit the damage it causes. I always recommend this as endometriosis creates scar tissue which can cause fertility issues.

186,Post,mjhlqa,Please help me understand my Mum’s final days (trigger warning: death),Carliebeans,This user has not yet been verified.,1617484937.0,"Trigger warning: details of death

Details: (not that they are relevant now). 65/female/~100kg
Medical history: stage IV RCC
Medications: too numerous to name, but was on Sunitinib 25mg, I know there is an increased risk of stroke with this medication

My Mum was battling stage IV RCC, we found out 2 months ago that her last ditch treatment was working (11 months after diagnosis).

She suffered a stroke on Thursday, as she was getting ready for the day. She was on her electric scooter in the bathroom (she amazingly hadn’t fallen off it), my Dad was with her a minute after it happened and he knew immediately what had happened because one side of her body was not moving and she was trying to communicate that she didn’t feel well but she couldn’t form the words. 

She was rushed to hospital and a CT showed she had had a stroke and there was a massive bleed in the middle of her brain. The emergency room doctor told us this was not survivable, that there was nothing they could do especially given the battle she had been facing. We understood and we know she didn’t want any heroic efforts to save her, didn’t want life prolonging treatments - we had spoken about this, thank God. We knew that even if she could survive, that she wouldn’t want to given that the stroke had affected the only side she could put weight on and there would be no way we could care for her at home any longer.

She had moments of opening her eyes and she could squeeze our hands and move her foot. There was a moment that she opened both eyes completely and looked right at me like she was really seeing me. That night, Dad laid beside her on a sofa bad and she kept reaching for his hand, she touched his face. I am so glad she was never alone.

The next morning, she was trying to reach up for the handle she had above her bed at home. She kept touching her left hip, rubbing her tummy and putting her hand to the left side of her head. I know she could feel the pressure building and she must have been in agony.

She had a syringe driver with her pain relief in it, and something to dry up the secretions. We told the doctor that she was feeling pain and must be feeling sick. They added extra pain relief and midazolam.

She had a few brief moments of raising her eyebrow and squeezing hands, but became more unresponsive.

She would feel burning hot at times and we tried to keep her cool with wet washers as we did not want her to start having seizures. Thankfully she didn’t have any seizures.

What I was not prepared for was the rattling chest, the sound of bubbling fluids in her airway, the leakage of secretions from her mouth, the suctioning of the secretions. It sounded like she was drowning to death. I did not know this would happen. This was incredibly traumatic and I can’t un-hear it. Her heart rate was 150BPM. I always thought the ‘death rattle’ was something that happened after death. The whole process of dying seemed incredibly barbaric.

We were with her when she died, thank God. I was on her right side, the side that was paralysed, holding her hand as I couldn’t bear to see the fluids leaking from her mouth. My Dad and sisters were on the other side. She opened her eyes and they say this was involuntary, she couldn’t see.  I hope she couldn’t because she wouldn’t have seen me, but I hope she knows I was with her until the very end.

I am utterly heartbroken, but I am also relieved that she did not have to linger in this state for too long. But I also feel a desperate need to know the facts.

My questions are;

1. Would she have known what happened to her when she had the stroke? She was so well up until the point she suddenly wasn’t, there was no lead up, no feeling of illness - just hope for the future and looking forward to spending the morning with one of her much loved grandsons.

2. Did she know we were there at the end, even though she couldn’t respond?

3. Could she feel those secretions? Did she feel like she was drowning? Could she feel her mouth and throat being suctioned? 

4. What did she die of? I know that sounds like a weird question, but I don’t understand the mechanics of death. Like did her brain die and her heart stopped because her brain couldn’t tell it to keep beating?

5. Would she have known she was dying?

She had said it would be far better to die from a heart attack, because it’s over quickly, that it was torture seeing us hurting. I just hope that the way she died was in someway similar to the swiftness of a heart attack. The End was always something that I dreaded because I was worried it would be agonising for her. I knew it would be for us, but I didn’t want it to be for her.

"" what I can say is that I'm terribly sorry for your loss, your mom sounds lovely and I can feel your love for her through your writing! 

>1. Would she have known what happened to her when she had the stroke? She was so well up until the point she suddenly wasn’t, there was no lead up, no feeling of illness - just hope for the future and looking forward to spending the morning with one of her much loved grandsons.

Possibly, but there's no way to be sure. At least when your dad found her it sounds like she was at least somewhat aware, even though at that point she was unable to find the language to tell you so. 

>2. Did she know we were there at the end, even though she couldn’t respond?

Again, there is no way to be sure, but I'm going to say probably yes. Death is a complex thing, but I've been taught that hearing is the last sense to be lost. Even if she could not fully process the words or respond, she was likely able to hear you. 

>3. Could she feel those secretions? Did she feel like she was drowning? Could she feel her mouth and throat being suctioned? 

I'm sure she had some sensations from it, yes. But between the pain medications and the damage to her brain, I don't think either would have made her uncomfortable for long. 

As far as the drowning feeling - we call that ""air hunger"" and it is very effectively treated with pain medications - they allow the dying person to rest and not feel like breathing is a struggle. 

For the death rattle, yes, that is truly awful to watch!  But I can at least offer this bit of comfort - it was much more distressing for you than it was for her. At that stage in the dying process she was not truly breathing, that was the last few electrical signals going from her brain to her body and she likely had no sensation or awareness of it.

>4. What did she die of? I know that sounds like a weird question, but I don’t understand the mechanics of death. Like did her brain die and her heart stopped because her brain couldn’t tell it to keep beating?

Something like that, yes. The stroke caused bleeding into her brain. Blood, when not in vessels, is extremely irritating to tissues, and caused a massive inflammatory response in her head. This causes pressure, also a significant amount of brain cell death. The brain can't handle all of this and starts shutting down. Your brainstem is in charge of breathing and heartbeat, and is the farthest from the spot that was bleeding - it either got pushed out of place by the pressure or stopped getting messages from the rest of her brain and could no longer function. Which is why breathing gets weaker/more ragged before the end, it just sort of tapers off.

>5. Would she have known she was dying?

This one I can't even give you a guess. Possibly yes, possibly no. Based on your description of her, however, I suspect that even if she did know she was dying it would not have brought her much distress. 

I hope you and your family are able to grieve her loss in relative peace, and keep her memory alive fondly. ❤",763,0,
189,Comment,mjhlqa,Please help me understand my Mum’s final days (trigger warning: death),mfitzy87,Physician,2021-04-04 01:45:05,"I’m so sorry for your loss. Hopefully I can provide some answers which can give you some peace of mind. I’m going to answer numerically for the ease of organizing my response:

1. It’s hard to know how aware of the stroke she was. Sometimes patients with motor deficits can realize what’s happening, but based on your information (specifically that it was near the center of the brain), it sounds like it was a significant stroke that may have also affected her awareness of what was happening.

2. There is a lot of research in the palliative care field that shows a dying person retains awareness of those around them. Hearing is known to be one of the last senses to shut down near death, so talking to loved ones is important even if they can’t respond.

3. Her awareness would have been pretty impaired by her stroke but also the medications sedating her. The medications given are the same that would be used to sedate someone for many medical procedures. Additionally, many morphine based medications block the feeing of ‘not getting enough air’, or what we call air hunger. For all these reasons, she would have been very comfortable even though it’s so disconcerting when you’re watching it happen.

4. This is hard to answer and I don’t want to make you uncomfortable going into various scenarios, but ultimately it sounds like enough pressure built up in her head that even the basic functions of the brain were being impacted. Ultimately her brain lost the drive to keep her heart and lung on autopilot. 

There was an article a few years ago that discussed how bleeding strokes in certain areas can cause a fast heart rate. When that happens, there is a high risk for coma and death. It is possible her heart couldn’t sustain the high rate and a heart attack also occurred. 

5. This is probably the hardest question of all to answer and I don’t think anyone could truly tell you for sure. Is it possible that she knew? It’s possible, but for her to have been able to fully take stock of what was happening, put the information together and come to the conclusion she was dying is probably unlikely. Her awareness was probably more focused on what was bothering her before she was made comfortable. Once she was comfortable, her remaining awareness was more likely focused on being surrounded by her loving family.

I truly am sorry for your loss. Based on what you said in the last paragraph, it sounds like she would have been much more content dying as she did than suffering from a long illness.

It sounds like you gave her what was most important- love and comfort when that was all she needed.",155,0,
190,Post,1bueafu,My GF has sudden amnesia and can't remember the last 3 years. Please help me think.,Still-Fan2038,Layperson/not verified as healthcare professional,1712102706.0,"Age: 26

Sex: Female

Height: 5ft 6inches

Weight: 174 pounds

Country: Belgium

So I'm in a bit of shock at the moment. My girlfriend woke up 3 days ago without knowledge of the last 3 years. Doctors are puzzled. Please help me think what this can be.

Some information: This isn't the first time this happened. In 2020, after waking up my gf covered herself up while naked and said 'What am I doing here, you're married'. Which I was, 2 years prior. Since then, I had divorced and was with my gf for about a year already. I took her to the hospital, when walking out of the house she couldn't remember ever being there nor that we had bought it together. She couldn't remember or car or our neighbour. When arriving at the hospital she asked my why everyone was wearing a mask (it was covid times).

Fast forward. That night I visited her at the hospital. She was acting like she would have been 2 years earlier. Flirty, but keeping distance. Also abit more childish in talk. When trying to kiss her it was awkward since in her head we weren't a couple.

The next morning she started remembering things. From onset until full memory recovery 36 hours had passed.

A year later a similar event happend. She couldn't remember the house we had since then moved into. The last 6 months were gone. After 12 hours she had recovered.

Next episode was abit different. After a big discussion she had lost the ability to speak. She could type but not talk. Went to ER. After 4 hours everything was normal.

What happened a few days ago has got me worried alot. We have 2 kids, all since the last 2 years. We have a baby monitor so I checked the footage:

7:14am all is normal. She wakes up and is acting like her normal self. She says to our first child to be cautious not to hurt the other. She says their names as well. After that she goes back to sleep.

7h19 am: She wakes up and says weird things she'd never said to our babies before. Kind of like saying 'sweetie' when always saying 'honey' for the last 2 years. She says 'who are these 2 sweeties'. 'what are you doing here'. I see her calling me (was in the other bed upstairs). She ask 'who are these kids'. I see her asking if my kid can walk already and just acting as if she sees them for the first time. I called the doctor, he came over and told us to go to the ER. In the meantime my gf was saying that the led lights in the house were flickering, which was not. I checked here pupil response with my smartphone flash and she got nauseous. She told me seeing stars for a few minutes after that. Way longer than usual.

She couldn't remember the last 3 years. She tought it was march 2021 instead of march 2024. She didnt know our kids. Went to the ER. When she was monitored her HR was 48bpm. She is known for tachycardia, her avg HR is 80 in rest. Never had it been 50 of lower, even in her deep sleep. This hr of 48-45 persisted for 2 hours after admission. Doctors didnt make anything of it. Got an MRI which was normal. Stayed for the night and got discharged. Still no memory 36 hours later.

She came home, got to know the kids again. Not by memory but by interacting with them. She doesnt know our house since we've only been living here for 2 years. She does't know anything from the last 3 years. Since then the only thing she started to remember was the birth of our kids. Thats all.

90 hours have passed and still nothing. Its weird and I dont know what to do. She does her best to do everyday tasks but she handles the kids differently. I'm so scared that this will persist.

Does anyone know what this could be? Doctor said functional neurological disorder.

Extra info: She remembers the episodes. She can make new memories during the episodes. In 2020 and in 2024 an mri was done. Both were normal.

We have had alot of stress. I have a feeling this is a trigger.

The 2nd episode which we have on camera makes it apperent that whatever happened, happend in a 5min timespan. Woke up fine, snoozed 5min and then it happened.

She complained about a bad headache when the last episode happened. As if her head was being torn apart. This persisted throughout the entire day.

Please pinpoint me in the right direction. I'm lost atm.

Best regards

Update 1: 100 hours into the episode, about 5% of her memories have come back. Schedulded neuro consult in another hospital tomorrow. Will do EEG and memory test.

Update 2 (4/4): EEG was normal. Second neurologist said she's never had a case like this before. She thinks it's FND as well. Psy consult was done as well, the main subject was focusing on trying to have as little stress as possible. Her memory is still coming back in little pieces, about 10-15% so far I think. But little progress is still progress.

  
Update 3 (7/4): She still has had headaches, which started on the day of the episode. Memories keep coming back. It's not in chronological order at all. About 70% has come back so far. ",592,165,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1bueafu/my_gf_has_sudden_amnesia_and_cant_remember_the/

This is a super disturbing experience to go through. I saw a patient who had something similar when I was a med student so did a bit of a readthrough of the literature (unfortunately he left the hospital against medical advice before we even got an MRI so we never found a definitive answer). Memory is a complex thing, and brains are generally weird—but there’s not really anything related to a clear disease process or physical damage in the brain that could plausibly cause memory loss like this in the absence of any other significant symptoms, generally normal cognitive function, or without a clear inciting event. A bad concussion can cause loss of previous memories for a while before the hit, but she didn’t hit her head—and it also stops you from making new memories. Seizures or migraines could cause some weird memory loss as a symptom, but it would not be permanent or tend to present like this. A stroke would be very unlikely to cause this and would also show up on MRI. When you take away the organic, what’s left is “functional”, which essentially means the “hardware” is intact but there’s some issue in the “software” that’s not functioning. It doesn’t equate to faking it, but it does mean that well-structured therapy is going to do much more than a medication or surgery could ever do. 

All that being said, this case is still weird enough (and severely disabling enough!) that I would make sure all basic avenues like an EEG and blood tests for weird stuff has been done. ",614,0,

I tried weed for the first time about 3 weeks ago, and overall I enjoyed the experience.  However, I was hallucinating while I was high, which is not particularly concerning but it comes into play later.  That first high was about 3 weeks ago off of a dab pen, and I have gotten high a few other times.  This weekend in particular I did a lot, taking multiple hits off of a dab pen on Saturday, Sunday, and Monday night.  Each time I woke up the next morning I felt fine, until Tuesday morning.  I thought I was still high because I was still hallucinating, but the hallucinations persisted all day.  Then I woke up today and the hallucinations persisted yet again.  I’m only experiencing one type of hallucination, which is the same type I got while being high.  My vision turns into what I would call a slideshow when I see something moving, particularly elevator doors or automatic doors or cars passing by.  Obviously this is very concerning, and it is very disruptive to my daily life.  Tonight I went to bed around about 3 hours ago and I felt panic setting in and my mind started to race with scary thoughts.  I haven’t been able to sleep at all.

I feel like my chest is being restricted and it’s just very uncomfortable. It’s also getting harder to breathe through my nose or throat it just feels awful.

Is it bad to have humidity? I live in one of the driest states and it’s just getting pretty hard for me. 

I took a covid test a few days ago but I’ve seen two doctors and they both believe that given my contact history of people with positive covid tests and my symptoms that I have it. I tested negative for other things like flu.

Edit: I have no prior health problems either but symptoms are worrying me.

Update: I spoke to my states Coronavirus hotline and the doctors who tested me. My heart rate is above normal but at this point the hospitals will be extremely crowded or already are. I stopped using a humidifier and I have to monitor my chest pain and breathing. 

It is hard to do like anything right now and I’m focusing on just trying to sleep and drink water. The pain has been pretty constant with maybe some light intervals of less pain(?) if that makes sense. But it hasn’t increased which is what they’ve told me to look out for. As of right now I have someone watching me so if it does get bad we can go to the nearest hospital.

203,Post,irzugz,How can I secretly get my nephew medical care without his parents knowing? (mental health),Unknown,,1600009591.0,"UPDATE: Thank you so much for all your help, guys. So many good points were brought up and your advice helped a lot. I was up all night mulling things over, and in the morning I decided to tell my sister everything, before the kids woke up. She was glad I spoke up. This morning she drove the girls to school, but let her son stay home. When she got back from school dropoffs she took him out for the day. They went for a drive to the park, got lunch, and talked. When they got home, my nephew had a nap on the couch. I didn't ask what was said, but my sister said things were smoothed out a bit, communication-wise, and she is monitoring his mood. He will try the school counsellor again, and from there we will see what needs to be done treatment-wise for his health. She also said that she explained to her son my choice to betray his trust, and he understands. Still, I will talk to my nephew, explain my choice to tell his parents, and apologise in person for spilling his secret. Just to make sure we are ok. Again, thank you everyone for your advice.

15M, 6+foot, ??kg, Caucasian, no current medication (afaik), no drugs or drinking. In New Zealand.

So tonight my nephew (15m) told me (25f) that he is struggling with what sounds like severe depression.

Long story short, he is struggling with the usual symptoms: low self esteem, constant suicidal thoughts, previous self-harm (once), anxiety, inability to focus on schoolwork, inability to fall asleep, inability to get a decent sleep, and on top of all that, frightening memory gaps. He comes home from school and literally has no answer to the question: *""How was school?""* He doesn't know. He doesn't remember.

My nephew is terrified of speaking to his parents about this. **NOTE:** they are incredible, supportive parents, but he hates to talk about this stuff and he is terrified of starting that conversation with them, because he is worried he will be forced out of his 'bottle it up' mentality. I have encouraged him to speak with his parents, but he adamantly refused. He specifically asked me not to tell his parents because he doesn't feel comfortable talking about it with them.

I don't want to betray my nephew's trust, but I know he needs better care and support than I can provide. I am living with the family at the moment, so I can offer at-home support. However, I think he needs to see a professional. These memory gaps are causing him to struggle in school, it's affecting his friendships, and it's affecting his home life. It's affecting his happiness. He is passively suicidal, but that could change at the drop of a hat. I want to know what I can organise for him without his mum and dad finding out and spilling the beans.. Is he able to get therapy? Does he need parental consent to try medications?

I know this isn't the typical 'AskDocs' question, and I apologise. But I would really appreciate any advice you can give me. Thank you in advance.",588,97,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/irzugz/how_can_i_secretly_get_my_nephew_medical_care/

206,Post,hy91ww,"Symptoms of breast cancer, feel discriminated against And not taken seriously by doctors because of my weight",OkEggplant3675,Layperson/not verified as healthcare professional.,1595778193.0,"TLDR; I know doctors hate it when the patient plays google doctor. However, I feel it is important to be educated when something potentially serious is going on with you. So I have done some reading (from reputable sources and medical journals) and strongly feel I am exhibiting symptoms of breast cancer. I feel doctors have ignored this because of my weight.

Background: I am a 25 year old female and now weigh nearly 250 lbs, almost 5’9”. Doctors have told me they think I have PCOS. I have been putting on weight for some time now, doctors have Said this gain could be due to the PCOS, however over 15lbs of the 30 or so I’ve gained in the last year has been in the last two months. And I’ve been actively trying to lose weight, even taking Contrave (bupropion/naltrexone) to help with my appetite. I also have a mirena IUD for BC and take spironolactone and Slynd (progesterone only oral BC) for cystic acne. They Slynd I’ve only been taking for three months.  


Symptoms: Aside from the weight gain, I have one breast that has rapidly grown in size (it seemed to happen in the span of about four days) and is now over a cup size bigger than the other. Both breasts suddenly have increased vein prominence, some blueish discoloration (almost like bruising), I’ve had red dots appear on the skin and the skin on my upper chest suddenly feels bumpy and scaley, and both are very sore and aching. Both have leaked completely clear discharge from the nipples when lightly expressed. Under my arms and into my back are quite sore as well. I feel generally tired as well.

I went to see a midwife in OBGYN for the first available appointment And she found a lump on the larger breast. I’m scheduled for an ultrasound on the 30th. However, when I left a message to say that they had become even more sore and to inform her about the new discharge, I was called by a nurse, told the midwife spoke to some doctors, and they wanted me seen in general surgery that day (this past Thursday).

The surgeon I saw was very rushed (they must have squeezed me in) and did an improper breast exam, not even feeling where I told him the lump had been found. He told me “nothing I was experiencing was a symptom of cancer.” And I “shouldn’t lose sleep over it.” He offered to give me antibiotics but said he “wasn’t sure what he’d be treating” so I refused them. He told me if I just lost 35-45lbs a lot of my “problems would go away”. He questioned whether or not I showered everyday. He was accusatory, telling me the timeline of my breast growth “just didn’t make sense”. I told him well, yeah, that’s why it’s concerning. He told me to see an endocrinologist for my hormones and weight and suggested cosmetic surgery for both my increased unilateral breast size and my weight.

I was offended. I felt ignored. I felt confused. Why was I told to rush in just to be blown off like that? I know from researching that these can all be symptoms of breast cancer. I feel like my symptoms are all being blamed on my weight rather than thinking about how sudden and rapid the weight gain was and that it may possibly be a symptom not the problem. 

I’m hoping this is a hormone issue, maybe due to the PCOS, but am afraid it’s something worse, like breast cancer.

 I feel at a loss right now. So many questions. How do I deal with what I feel is weight discrimination in a medical setting? Are these symptoms more concerning than doctors are letting on? What hormonal issue could cause these problems, if it is that? Why have the doctors been dodging my questions about it being cancer? Has anyone else experienced anything like this?

Based on your story it is unlikely that you have breast cancer as your symptoms are not consistent with breast cancer. Typical when it comes to lumps and bumps: painful = not cancer and painless = could be cancer. Obviously this is a generalization but the very fact that your breasts are sore leads me to believe it is not cancer but very likely instead something like Fibrocystic changes.  

Read about it here: https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/fibrocystic-breasts/symptoms-causes/syc-20350438

Fibrocystic changes are super common. Due to hormonal changes people might experience changes in breast size, breast tenderness, and lumps in the breasts. These changes are completely benign and are related to hormones. 

Generally speaking, no doctor that can tell you with 100% certainty if you can cancer or not based solely on a breast exam. That is why you’re scheduled for an ultrasound. However, based on your story and what they said they decided it was unlikely. With you having an ultrasound already scheduled there’s not much the surgeon could do before having the results. I would recommend you request a different physician because you do deserve to feel listened to and respected and it doesn’t sound like that’s what you experienced. 

It is reassuring that your symptoms don’t sound like cancer. You are also very young and while people your age can absolutely get breast cancer it would be less likely that that’s the case. You will have to wait until your ultrasound results and have an evaluation with your doctors then.",154,0,
210,Post,1381oo3,(30F) I'm feeling gaslit by my medical team and need a knowledgeable outside opinion.,LearningtoKnowMyself,Layperson/not verified as healthcare professional,1683238130.0,"This is a question primarily for my L&D/OBG internet friends. 7 weeks ago I gave birth to a big healthy baby. It was a long labor (29 hours), first time mom. The first 24 hours I went unmedicated, and then the last 5 I chose to use pitocin and an epidural to help relax my pelvic floor and give my uterus the ""oomf"" it needed to get the babies head past my pubic bone. Once that kicked in I began making great progress and baby's heartrate was awesome the whole time. As the baby is about ready to be born the on-call doctor came in and immediately recommended an episiotomy. In the middle of a contraction I yelled ""No!"" So the doctor's concerned that the baby is going to get their shoulders stuck behind my pubic bone and tells me I need to deliver the baby in one push. I counter argue that hands and knees is the better position for stuck shoulders, but the doctor insists that it's not an option since I had an epidural. She tells me to push 3 times on my next contraction, and that for my babies safety they must be delivered on this next round or they'll need to do a c-section. I pushed twice with all I had, and before I could push a third time she stuck both her hands inside my vaginal canal, grabbed the babies head, and ripped the entire body out in one pull. My husband and doula saw the whole thing. I didn't even get to do Golden hour with my baby, because I was immediately wheeled down to OR for surgery because the surgeon said it was one of the worst tears they had ever seen. My medical team keeps telling me that ""at least the baby is alive and you'll heal,"" while also scheduling me for another surgery to re-do my stitches and lazering off granulated tissue. In your experience, does this feel right to you? My fecal incontinence is so bad that I can't go back to work. Hell, I can only usually make it to the bathroom in my own house. I'm already signed up for pelvic floor, but I won't be able to start that until I've healed from this next round of stitches. Basically, what I'm wondering is do I have really bad luck, or is this worth talking to the hospital about. Yes, yes, the most important thing is the baby is safe, but it really feels like the doctor was impatient and decided to use the jaws of life instead of trying the door first. Thank you for your insight, I really appreciate your outsiders perspective.

*edit for spelling errors.

Update:
I would like to thank the physicians/OBGYs/Doulas/Nurses and other medical staff who have shared their valuable input on this thread. Your unbiased viewpoints are helping me navigate my feelings, and asses the situation from various perspectives. I still feel like the OBGYN treated my body as a barrier to the safe birth of my child, instead of a partner, able and willing to assist in the delivery. I am also upset by the fact that I've realized that both of the residents, nurses, and my own OBGYN made time to check in with me as I recovered at the hospital, and this particular doctor never once followed up to see how I was doing. I went ahead and requested the birth notes from the office this morning, and for those interested, this is all they said:

""This 30 year old G1P0 was complete at 04:43 and delivered a viable female infant in the OA position at 12:15 on 03/12/2023. Delivery of fetal vertex with maternal effort. No nuchal cord noted. Delivery of body and shoulders was completed without difficulty, with application of axial traction. Infant with good spontaneous cry and good tone. The infant was handed off to waiting nursing team. Blood was drawn for cord arterial and venous gases and cord blood. The cord was doubly clamped and cut after the cord had stopped pulsating per patient request. The placenta was delivered via manual extraction at 12:44. Intact, 3 vessel cord noted. The vagina, cervix, and perineum were examined. Fourth degree perineal laceration noted. Decision made to proceed to operating room for laceration repair to allow for better patient positioning and lighting. EBL 300 cc. ""

For those non-medical people commenting, remember opinions are like assholes: everyone has one, and everybody thinks their smells nicer than everyone else's. Also, it's incredibly depressing how a woman advocating for her body and the safety of her child is seen as ""arguing with the doctor."" You weren't there, you did not hear how I worded things, so to just assume that I was throwing a tantrum or in an altered mental state is ignorant and sexist.

An additional piece of information that I did not include at the time of this original post due to wanting to avoid bias is that this particular doctor has been bounced around multiple hospitals in our area because of her abnormally high c-section and episiotomy rates. In retrospect, this bias did color my original post, but it is information worth considering as I decide whether or not to bring a complaint about my experience to the hospital.

Once again, yes, yes, I'm so grateful that the baby is fine, but for the love of God, stop saying that. When someone's house burns down and they lose their dog, telling them to be grateful for their own life, and that's the risk you take when you decide to have a pet does not make them feel better, and it only makes you out to be an ass. I can be grateful for the health of my baby and still question the quality of care I received.",581,170,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1381oo3/30f_im_feeling_gaslit_by_my_medical_team_and_need/

From what you're describing, I believe it's likely not that they were worried that the baby's shoulder was *going to* get stuck behind your pubic bone, but rather that the shoulder *was* stuck. When this happens, it is an obstetric emergency. The position of the baby when this occurs tends to lead to compromised blood flow through the umbilical cord due to compression, and because it isn't fully out yet, baby can't breathe on their own yet. In this situation, there is a VERY short window we have to release the shoulder and get baby out to prevent permanent brain damage and/or death of the baby.

The maneuvers that we use to try to release a stuck shoulder can indeed look like someone is reaching up and grabbing the head to pull baby out. In reality, they're reaching past the head to the shoulder.

It sounds like once the shoulder was freed up, baby was out pretty much immediately, which is good for baby, but unfortunately the rapid end to the delivery may have contributed to your bad tear. Or it's possible a severe tear could have happened anyway. With a first time mom and a large baby, there was a risk for more tearing from those factors alone.

I hope you're able to sit down with your OB and get a thorough explanation of what happened from their perspective, because at the end of the day, all we're able to do here is make our best guesses based on your description and our medical knowledge. At a minimum it sounds like there could have been better communication with you both during and immediately after the delivery.

I wish you the best in your healing process- physically, mentally, and emotionally. You've been through a traumatic experience from all fronts, even if medically the right things were done, and I hope you're able to address all of them in time.

That’s just…not possible. Did she use forceps? Vacuum? Those are the only real tools that allows us to help a baby’s head out that hasn’t fully crowned yet.

The only time I reach my hand in is if a shoulder is stuck and I have to do maneuvers to get baby unstuck. But if the head isn’t out yet, there’s no amount of pulling with my bare hands that I can do to get a baby out.

I suggest you ask your OB to review the notes with you.

It started with his left leg turning inwards as he walked and got tired. Family doctor did a physical and noticed slight curvature in the spine and extra movement in his left hip, recommended ortho specialist. I took him to Shriners to check for scoliosis. First visit ruled that out, the curve was well within normal range. Xray reveled slightly less than 1cm difference in length and an enlarged hip joint. Doctor said all minor issues that shouldn't effect him long term and should even correct itself.

Over the next 6 months it got progressively worse, he constently drops to the ground like a sack of potatoes. Not tripping, his leg literally collapses on him. He started having poop in his underwear constently, I thought it was unrelated early on and just a behavior thing (boy wanting to play and not stop to poop). His fine motor skills also aren't developing. He struggling to hold shoe laces and tie his shoes, pencils, etc...

We go to the follow up visit and I mentioned everything, they seemed super concerned and did another set of x-rays. The leg difference got slightly larger (estimated a full cm now) and spine was still the same but they saw his walk was awkward and the left leg turning in. Ordered a Gait (spelling) study which confirmed there was issues with his walking but they weren't able to tell me why or even what corrective measures we could take. They recommended an MRI.

Due to covid it took almost 2 months to get an appointment for the full brain and spine mri, apparently looking for tethered cord, chiari malformation, etc. Today we got the MRI results and everything seems perfect where it supposed to be, no compression, no lesions, cranial opening is perfectly normal.

I was praying for a physical problem, like tethered cord. So it could be addressed.

Now I'm set to see neurologist is August, genetics and GI in October.

This rabbit hole is scary. Things like muscular dystrophy, MS, and other nerve problems all come to mind. Most of which cant even be treated.

I'm overwhelmed. I'm scared. I'm crying whenever hes not looking. I've raised him alone since he was 7 months old, my job is to protect him and I cant. I watch him try to play everyday woth friends, only to fall and be embarrassed, or unable to keep up because he cant run properly. He pops right back up when he falls, but I know deep down eventually even his spirit will break and I'm not ready.

It is hard to stay strong for your son.  It doesn’t take a genius to realize that you are in a tough situation.

My recommendation is to just take care of him and love him like you have always done. Look for support groups so you can vent to others who have gone through similar things.

If you know anything about drugs in the US right now, you know the fentanyl is being cut with xylazine, a horse tranquilizer, toxic to humans, that can lead to flesh eating wounds that often end in amputation. They’re not exactly the same as these wounds he has, his are a LOT less severe, but to me it looks like these are the start of what will eventually become those more extreme wounds (look up pics of “xylazine wounds” or “tranq fent wounds” if interested, warning: it’s nasty.) There are not hard lumps under these spots or wounds or whatever you may call them, they’re not hot to the touch or anything, just super gross and concerning looking. He thinks they’re just raised because they’re abscesses that need drained, and the black spots are the xylazine wounds starting to develop. Which he could very possibly be right about, but he wants to cut them open himself at home and let them drain or stab them with a needle repeatedly until they begin to drain.

My city has three facebook groups and two reddit communities; all five have people offering to help others including childcare. So far I'm aware of two medical care families that are getting free childcare from community members. Other people in my city are doing things for others so they can stay out of the hospital.

Examples of the above. We have some wonderful next door neighbors; both in their 70's. One is type 2 diabetic with other significant health issues. The other grew up in Asia with horrible air quality and is borderline asthmatic. If either of them contract this their chance of survival is very low. I like them, both my kids totally adore them. They're pretty well stocked for now. They also have my phone number and know I'll pick anything up at the store. So yea, ""it's only one household"" but that's one less couple that will occupy a hospital room/bed. Nearly all elderly people I know of in out city are in the same position.

No smoking or drug use in the house and no history of abuse. Duration: 3 days ago for sure but maybe much longer (see below). 

We got a call from my daughter's school recently because another little girl had hurt her ankle at recess. While the teacher was going to get the nurse to ice and wrap her ankle, my daughter kicked the chair the girls foot was propped up on out from under her and then stomped on her foot. When she was asked why she did this, she said there was a voice in her head that told her if she didn't do it her little sister (6 years old) was going to die.

The school had me pick her up and take her to Children's Hospital for an emergency evaluation before she was allowed to return to school. There, she told the counselor that she has had these thoughts for a while but this is the first time that she was ""told"" to hurt someone else. Normally the voice/thoughts made her hurt herself or ""something bad will happen"" (usually to a family member). The counselor told us that my daughter was not considered an immediate threat to herself or others and could return to school with the recommendations that my daughter always tell a trusted adult when she was having these thoughts and for us to follow up with a mental health professional as soon as possible.

When I asked my daughter more details about what was going she said that this has been going on for months but she has kept it from us. She has been pulling out strands of hair, eyelashes, punching herself, or throwing herself against things.  I said, ""Well wouldn't we have seen the bruises if this were true?"" And she told me that she has always made up a story about her cuts and stuff because she thought we'd be mad that she was doing this to herself. Looking back now there have been a lot but it has never seemed excessive and kids get bruised all the time.  Now I'm kicking myself for not noticing.

An autopsy was done and he was perfect.  They studied the placenta and found that most likely a blood clot had appeared on the placenta, and because he did not have any sort of growth restriction, they assume that it was very sudden. 

I am not very clear on this. The death happened as I was traveling to another country, and gave birth there but did not have follow on discussions with doctors. An amazing midwife shared the reports with me but as they are not in English - they are in French-  my obstetrian did not really analyse them ( I am in the UK).

I was tested for blot clotting disorders, which came back clear. 


I had a live birth in 2018, my ""Triumph over my mental health"" baby was born at 37 weeks, very small (2.4kg) and jaundiced but perfect.

I had another live birth in 2020, my ""I am done after this"" baby was born at 37+5 weeks. During this pregnancy was diagnosed with gestational diabetes ( first time I was tested) so was hospitalised for steroid shots prior to induction.

 At that point I noticed reduced movement, and eventually they spotted that the baby was struggling through Braxon Hicks (heart decelerations and stopping) so they took her out. She was born also very small (2.5kg) but perfect.


I know most stillbirth are unexplained, but I wonder if the struggles that my 3rd baby went through were linked or caused by the issue that my first baby faced?

Could there be a link? 

We are not planning on having another child so this is really to help me process everything that we went through. I can't help feel that I manage to save her (3rd baby) but failed him. 
I appreciate that this information is all very vague, as you can probably guess I am not a health professional! 

Many thanks in advance

 The first thing is that you appear to grow quite small babies. We know that those in the bottom 10 percent for growth are higher risk during the pregnancy. Obviously this doesn't mean they are all at risk in that bottom 10 percent, but some may be small for reasons to do with the placenta. It also means they are more likely to find physiological stress difficult (labour).

 It may all be linked but it may not. There are other things to know, such as;

Do you smoke? 

If so how many a day? 

What is your BMI?

What is your and your partners heights?

Any blood pressure problems in the family?

Any blood pressure problems in your pregnancies?

Have you been on Aspirin in any of your pregnancies?

Any evidence of an autoimmune disease like Lupus?

Did you get gestational diabetes in the third pregnancy?

How is the growth of your children since delivery?


 The post mortem from France may give further evidence as you can sometimes see issues with the placenta's formation and application in to the uterus that can cause an increased risk of still birth.

 Abruptions are relatively freak events. They are higher in smokers and people with blood pressure issues, but sometimes they just occur out of the blue. It may be linked to your small babies, but it also might not be, it's difficult to say without further information, though I have an suspicion that there may be an element of pre-eclampisa there, but I am not able to prove anything further than this.",302,0,

So it sounds worse than it is. After years of being in pain and then looking into things then basically saying “hmm we don’t know” I have been left to basically suffer through it with tylenol or ibuprofen for help. Problem is I had a stomach bleed twice so I can’t do NSAIDs and they know this. A few months back I was suicidal due to being in so much pain. I talked to some friends who suggested Kratom. 

I was skeptical and it’s illegal in my state so I was hesitant, but desperate. I ended up taking it and now I’m happy and it controls my pain very well, and as a bonus my anxiety. My question is do I be honest and tell my primary care at my next appointment? I feel like If I do I’ll immediately be marked a drug user and they won’t take my symptoms seriously in order to figure out the bigger problem which is why I am feeling so much pain, fatigue and strange symptoms. 

I understand I’ll be looked at like a drug addict, but at the same time I’d never have resorted to this If I was taken seriously and they helped control my pain through any other method.

Kratom is very legal in most states. It's a supplement/herb, and people take all sorts of bullshit stuff all the time. 

Kratom has an opioid-like compound in it. It's closer to buprenorphine/suboxone in how it works (partial agonist) than oxycodone. Basically, it only partially activates the receptor, unlike morphine, fentanyl, etc that fully activate it. Because of this, it doesn't have the overdose risk of those other meds. Folks get quite dependent on it when on it chronically, and sometimes we need to treat them with suboxone while they come off (I've had folks need to stop it for a heart arrhythmia and for seizures). 

I would let your doctor know. It will both underscore the seriousness of your pain, as well as help them keep you safe. There are drug interactions that may come up. They should follow your labs (kidney and liver function especially). Probably worth checking an EKG too. If you have a history of arrhythmias, or a family history of sudden cardiac death at an early age, I would not take it. Same goes for if you've ever had seizures.

You should still try to pursue a treatment for whatever is causing the pain. 

If it is benefitting you a lot, I think a low dose of buprenorphine would potentially help too. With the end of the x-waiver to write for it (for opioid use disorder, but that made it scary to write for it for pain), you may have luck getting your doc to try it.",288,0,
234,Post,nddl5d,"My [M21] grandfather and all his 6 siblings on a remote island off Western Ireland were bipolar/schizophrenic, then all went on to develop dementia. (Virtually no access to medical care.) What could it have been, & are my siblings & I at risk of inheriting?",Unknown,,1621128936.0,"I am wondering whether I should get tested for Huntington's disease, although I know that is not a decision to ever take lightly. I myself am schizophrenic & manic-depressive (official dx, schizoaffective d/o bipolar type) and was on various antipsychotics from ages 15 to 20. I received electroconvulsive therapy at 16. 

Their personal trauma and tragedy haunts our family with sadness, and because they never really had access to any adequate care or testing (much less medication for their psychosis), we truly don't know if this is just a feak genetic loading for mental illness with a hefty precipitous dose of intergenerational trauma that resulted in dementia, or if there was something organic, neurological going on. It doesn't make sense that every single one would go on to end in dementia.

They grew up on an island off the coast of County Mayo in Western Ireland, all primarily Irish speaking, and despite intelligence and intellectual yearnings (my granddad read Greek and Latin, did translations, copied out Shakespeare, and when he was homeless basically lived in a chain bookstore after he'd come to America), literally no formal education beyond learning to read and write.

They were shepherds, basically. Sustained themselves on the island. The doctor had to (still today actually) come from the mainland to visit the families. Back then, they didn't have gas stoves or electricity or anything on this part of Ireland so you can imagine how dismal their healthcare was. Some came to America, some didn't. My grandad for all of my life lived with or near us here.

Working family theories are so far: ""Something in their water... 🤔"" so I'm trying to get a more empirical picture of what could have happened to my family, and whether myself or my siblings are at risk of something inherited. It just doesn't make sense that every one would develop dementia like clockwork. Is that possible? And they were completely antipsychotic naive too, so it's not like that's a possible culprit.

I really don't know. I didn't think much of it before except: ""Everyone in my family before me went proper fucking mad and had all this horrible shit happen to them (trauma) so it makes sense to me that I went proper mad too I guess.""

I think Huntington's disease sounds eerily congruent, but also deeply frightening. I have an identical twin. Idk. I seriously appreciate any help you may be able to offer me.

Edit: Also: lot of cousin marriage. It was normalized. And they all developed dementia fairly early: 50's and 60's.

Hear a report of a male in front of a restaurant that had been standing in the parking lot for over 3 hours, but had not moved an inch. We watch him for a little bit and he is just standing up, feet shoulder width apart, facing the sun in the middle of the parking lot. 

We make contact. Upon getting closer to him he doesn't move, but I notice his lips were cracked around the entire outside of his mouth like one of the sponge Bob thirsty faces (best way to describe it) and he had frothy white foam pouring from his mouth with blood coming out of the top and mixing in with the foam. The blood appeared to come from his gums and was mixing in with the white foam that looked like toothpaste. He still had not moved an inch, it was like his feet had been nailed to the pavement. 

We are talking to him, he seems to be tweaking, but is still somewhat coherent, but not to the point we believed he would become volatile and attack us, so we dispatch for EMS. We are trying to gather information from him or get him to move but he just wouldn't. All of his answers were jumbled and he refused to move an inch, just kept standing upright. His hands were slightly twitching like something was effecting his motor control. 

While we are waiting for EMS to arrive I asked him multiple times if he had taken any narcotics (I had seen OD's and this wasn't like any I have dealt with), which he replied no. I asked him multiple times if he had recently came into contact with any animals, he responded no everytime. I know some of the symptoms of rabbies but he seemed to deny the possibility and had an empty energy drink by his feet that he confirmed he drank. 


EMS arrives and we sit him down, he was unable to move his legs and it was like they had stiffened up, the phone in his left hand was almost cracking he was gripping it so hard and his wrist was contorted weirdly, while his right hand was making movement as if he was typing on a key board. 


The man appeared homeless, so we at first assumed narcotics usage but there was just something weirdly unsettling about this one, I have never seen anything like it.

Lately we've been seeing more and more overdoses presenting exactly as you describe. The first one i responded to the gentleman was 'locked' into a standing position, could not move, we attempted to assist him into a sitting position and were unable to as his whole body was locked. He had a lighter clutched in his hand and the plastic casing had cracked due to how hard he was clenching it. He was able to speak the entire time but it took extreme effort on his behalf and he could only answer yes or no. We're seeing dozens of these OD presentations weekly and seems to be related to dirty crack laced with fent and an analog (i don't have a specific name sorry)
I would like to applaud you for your handling of this entire situation, you showed extreme compassion and understanding for an extremely vulnerable person, it's refreshing to read about a kind, empathetic approach that ended well for all, keep up the good work :)

EDIT: It's been brought to my attention that my previous edit was worded in a misleading manner, I can not speak in a definitive manner of which drug is triggering these responses, local information has shown after testing community drug supply that we are seeing a rise in fentanyl cut with benzos and that it may or may not be related to the increase in unusual overdose presentations.
My original reply to OP was to state that I have seen and witnessed this overdose presentation and that we are seeing an increase in this presentation within our community. I am neither a medical professional nor deeply versed in anything other than basic drug knowledge, I am a Shelter Resource Worker (very new, have been in this role for 3+ months) who responds to OD's and am learning as I go.
Thank you to everyone who has responded with studies and other great sources, you are helping to not only educate myself, but others who may also been dealing with these situations in their own community, education is important and the more knowledge we have, the better we are able to serve our communities in times of crisis.

244,Comment,om6b7b,Seeking medical advice on the abortion process of a friend of mine,morriganrising,"Physician, OB-GYN",2021-07-17 22:13:12,"First, I am sorry that you do not have a medical professional locally that can help you with this. It is difficult to give advice on these things without a relationship with the patient. Especially because you have minimal support from medical professionals if the advice leads to complications. 

That being said, I will write out my general counseling when I have helped a woman with a medication abortion in the past. 

In the US, we only use mifepristone and misoprostol for medication abortion. Methergine is a medicine used to make the uterus contract and decrease bleeding. It is contraindicated in hypertension. Without going into details with a physician and monitoring, I would not use methergine. 

How I counsel patients:
1. Medication administration: take the mifepristone, and 24-48 hours later take the misoprostol (800mcg). You should start to have cramping and bleeding within 12 hours of taking this. 
2. What to expect: Nausea and cramping (usually more than period cramps) and bleeding like a heavy period. You may or may not pass clots and tissue. By the end of 24 hours from the start of bleeding, it should be tapering off to a lighter flow similar to a period. 
I usually send medication for nausea to help. 
For the cramping: Ibuprofen 800mg every 8 hours, staggered with Acetaminophen 1000mg every 6 hours. Some providers will give even stronger medication such as narcotics. 
Please note, ibuprofen should be avoided in patients with kidney disease. 
Please don’t use anything in the vagina for bleeding. 
3. When to go to the emergency room: Fever, feeling very unwell/severe dizziness. Especially with a history of anemia, she is at risk of heavy bleeding that could cause problems. Severe pain could be a sign of a complication as well. Lastly, heavy bleeding where you fill a pad an hour for more than two hours in a row should prompt going to the ED immediately. 
4. Risks of the procedure: Heavy bleeding or life-threatening bleeding, failure of the medication (about 5-10% if less than 8 weeks along) and infection. These risks are substantially higher at more than 10 weeks gestation. 

One last thought, in the unlikely event that she needs to go to the emergency room it is very difficult to tell the difference of a complicated medication abortion and natural miscarriage. A physician cannot tell the difference unless you disclose that information. I never recommend hiding information from your doctor, but I would also not want you to be discouraged from going to the emergency room in the interest of secrecy. 


Hopefully, this if helpful to you!

EDIT: 
5. Follow up: please follow up with a medical professional to ensure everything has passed safely and get effective contraception. 
If the medication is unsuccessful you can have infections and other complications. Prevention of unintended pregnancy is the most important aspect of abortion care. 
She should also know her blood type, because some guidelines recommend receiving a medication called Rhogam at the time of bleeding. This is to prevent antibodies from the embryo if you are Rh negative. Antibodies in your blood make future pregnancies and blood transfusions complicated and riskier.",830,0,

Lost 60kg (132lbs) since July, most of it since August through quite severe calorie restriction. Recently started purging too. Yada yada yada. I know I have an eating disorder, and I am trying to get help. 

But the thing is, my doctor sent me to a mental health team for help (I didn’t get much of a choice but wasn’t too against it, I wanted help for my anxiety more but they are focused on my eating). Initially saw a psychiatrist, diagnosed me with anorexia nervosa (atypical coz I’m obese obviously). 

After seeing the psychiatrist, I went back to my gp and she told me that they said I needed to stop losing and maintain my weight. They didn’t mention this to me and I was confused. 

Anyway, I see a psychologist there every week now. He said last time with the therapy and treatment, the aim is for me not to lose or gain, but maintain the weight.

I just don’t get it. I’m still overweight by a lot. Which is unhealthy. Isn’t it wrong of them to not want me to lose weight?

I really do not want to stop losing weight for any amount of time. And I’m not underweight. I need to lose weight. 

I have a feeling this is their standard treatment for people with eating disorders. But for someone like me who is overweight, shouldn’t it be altered to support healthy weight loss still? Or am I wrong?

The psychologist also said something about “set weight” and many factors can influence a weight range normal for each individual, and I might be in mine. But that sounds crazy to me. They want me to stay obese? I’ve been obese my entire life, and I’ve only started doing something about it last year. I’ve been able to come off various meds and my blood tests were great (recent). I’m not dying or anything from this “ eating disorder”, so I also feel a bit dumb getting help. But at the same time I do want help to stop some of the behaviours I’m doing and the obsessive food and calories stuff. 

But basically, are they going about this the wrong way? Or am I wrong?

Any insight helpful, especially from any medical professionals or people with experience in these areas.

Edited to add: Thanks for all the comments, I do appreciate people taking them time to comment. Part of me knows you’re all correct, just another part of me is struggling to accept this and finding it hard. I have an appointment at the place with the psychologist today, and an appointment with my GP in a few days, so I may voice my concerns so they’re aware.",561,120,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/fcastk/im_obese_but_have_been_told_by_a_mental_health/

That means that it is far more important to get to a place where you have a healthy relationship with eating and your weight, which you definitely do not have right now, and an important part of that is to *stop thinking about your weight*. The number on the scale is an approximation of your health status for a large swath of the population, but it is not a good overall indicator of what is happening in your specific case at all, and given the remarkably unhealthy way you're focused on it despite clear medical advice from an expert team, you definitely have a bigger problem here. 

Rapid weight loss is very risky on its own, regardless of how much you still weigh. You need to stop. 300 cal a day is so severely under your daily needs that you are seriously risking not only your long term health here, but your life.",1035,0,

It makes sense that the first intervention is to try to manage your eating disorder, because without that everything else is like trying to manage high blood pressure while you are on fire. Your weight is not the right priority because it's not the high-risk, high-acuity problem you face. You say you're not dying or anything from this eating disorder; the problem is that you can start dying *very quickly.*

It makes sense to address your eating disorder first, and then potentially address healthy and sustainable weight loss later if necessary.",329,0,
252,Post,gizqg9,No one knows what is wrong with me. I really need some help.,thaliaenid,Layperson/not verified as healthcare professional.,1589378938.0,"Basic information: 26F, 5'0, 132lbs, no medication, no drinking, no smoking, no drugs.

I've been thinking of posting here for weeks now. I'm just a little tired of telling my story over and over again and no one can tell me what is wrong. Hope you're sitting because this is going to be a long reading. My apologies. 

From what I remember, it all started when I was 14. I suffered from Dengue hemorrhagic fever and nearly died from it. I recovered but my health never was the same. I started having pain in my hips and knees, which doctors examined with x-rays and told me they were growing pains and was normal. I experienced some swelling in my legs and stiffness in my hips all the time but I would take some panadol and go on with my life. Also, I remember that I was sick all the time. Colds, urinary infections, sore throat and tonsilitis were common.

Then I started to have severe problems with my digestive system at 16. I've had problems with my stomach before but this was something serious. Constant nausea and vomiting episodes that weren't related to stomach flu and in the ER treated them like gastritis. The food I consumed wasn't getting porperly digested and it would form a ball in my stomach. It was so painful and the only thing that I could do to alleviate the pain was to vomit. The gastroenterologist I was seeing told me that it wasn't normal and after a bunch of exams diagnosed me with hypochlorydria. 

During that time, I was experiencing problems with my period and hormones as well as some urinary infections. My pcp referred me to a gynecologist. They did some blood work which revealed some hormonal imbalance, and sonograms that came back normal. They tested my thyroid and it came back normal. So the gyn prescribed the pill to help with the irregular and painful periods. I didn't take it because I was afraid of the possible repercusions that taking it could cause. 

Now I'm 19 and the problems with my hips and knees persisted through all this time and were getting worse. I've managed them with panadol and advil and when they were unbearable I went to the ER. My pcp at the moment referred me to a physiatrist. The physiatrist examined my case and did new x-rays which showed some narrowing of the knee joint but ranged normal and did some blood work. I started experiencing other symptoms like numbness in arms and legs, stiffness, pain in elbows and shoulders, inflamation all over, headaches, fatigue. Because of the numbness he did an EMG that came back normal.

He thought it could be autoimmune, so he tested my ANA that came back high positive. He referred me to a rheumatologist. The rheumatologist did more blood work which came back normal except for my ANA that was positive again. There were some other test that came normal but they were high normal. She dismissed my symptoms and told me that it was nothing. She didn't do any follow up with me. 

My physiatrist treated me with cortisone injections on my knees when they were so swollen that I couldn't walk. Those injections helped for a short period of time but the problems persisted. He referred me to ortho and the ortho totally dismissed my symptoms, didn't even look at me and told me it was probably chondromalacia patellae because of what I told him. I didn't do any sport or anything at that time or at any time, so it didn't make any sense to me. My physiatrist told me that he just hit a wall and didn't know what to do anymore. I stoped looking for answers because I was tired.

My first college years were horrible. The problems persisted. I went to ER with the vomiting episodes as well as the knee swelling.  My pcp repeated the blood work periodically to monitor everything. I was fatigued all the time. There was a time when I went to the ER because I couldn't move my right leg. My leg just couldn't respond. In the ER they did x-rays and other testing that came back normal and they told me that because I was on my period it could be the inflamation what was causing that. It didn't make sense to me but I was used to that. The problems persisted but I managed them again. As I was having so much problems with my period and my acne was the worst I started the pill. My cicle and acne improved. 

My first year of graduate school I began experiencing sore throat. I thought that it was just a cold because I was always sick. Then I looked at my throat and there was a little lesion in the area surrounding the right tonsil but it was more near my teeth. My pcp referred me to an ENT. Apparently it was a salivary gland stone or something like that. It resolved itself. Then, months later I woke up one day with a peritonsillar abscess. No previous infection, no warning. It just came out of nowhere. It was drained at the hospital and for like a month all was well. Then another one came out of nowhere. Then I went to the ENT and they gave a me a date to take out my tonsils because my case was severe. Then one month later came another one, so they couldn't do the surgery. And finally, the last one came a month later. So, in total I suffer (was tortured) from 4 peritosillar abscesses in a period of 6 months. Then they did the surgery and there where some complications. I went to the ER because I had a vomiting episode. I recovered from the surgery well.

My symptoms came and went and I managed them. Then in 2017-2018 I experienced accute stress caused by different situations (Hurricane María, the aftermath, personal situations and more). In august 2018 my body colapsed. It began with the pain and inflamation on my knees and then it got worse in a matter of days. Really worse. My pcp prescribed initially corticosteroids to treat the inflamation and that helped at the beggining of the symptoms but it was something else and I knew that this was going to be the worst episode I would experience. I began experiencig problems with coordination, extreme fatigue, muscle weakness, vertigo, dizziness, problems with balance, gait abnormality, headaches (migraines), numbness in feet and hands, general joint pain, joint stiffness, general inflamation, brain fog, pins and needles on feet, toes and fingers turning blue with cold temperature, mi skin would turn red (like a fish net or something like that) with cold temperature, severe anxiety, and some other symptoms. I gain weight dramatically because I couldn't exercise or even move normally. I was depressed because I couldn't understand what was happening to me.

Initially, my pcp did some x-rays, blood work (ANA positive again), referrals to ortho and neurologist. Ortho ordered an EMG/NCV and confirmed muscle weakness. Because of the bureucratic process of referrals and long waiting for the appointments, the neurologist saw me like two or three months after my symptoms got worse, I was starting to recover very slowly. She wanted to rule out an MS diagnosis, so she ordered the MRI's before, so she could have the results at the appointment. It was all normal, so no MS. She ordered different lab tests for autoimmune diseases. This time all came back normal including ANA. Then she referred me to rheumatologist again because, in her opinion, my case resembles lupus. This is not the first time I hear that word because since the first time my physiatrist suggested it could be autoimmune my pcp thought of lupus. 

2019 - Rheumatologist saw me like two months later which is like 6 months since my symptoms started getting worse. I was better but still couldn't walk properly. She agreed that it could be lupus or the beginning. She was awesome the first visit, reassuring me that she would help me. She ordered blood work for autoimmune diseases, bone scan and some x-rays. All came back normal but the bone scan which showed inflamation on my knee as if I had injured myself. That was not the case. The second visit I came with the results and she asked me again where it hurts on my knee and when I explained she told me it wasn't supposed to hurt there. The reality is that I was 25 years old and it is not expected to be experiencing pain anywhere at that age but there I was. She told me it was nothing, dismissed my symptoms and told me that I need to exercise. I couldn't even walk properly and the joint pain was horrible, how I was supposed to exercise? I felt so discourage and frustrated with everyone. I felt like I was crazy and that all was on my head. I doubted myself and my symptoms. 

After being more depressed than ever for several weeks, I decided that I needed to get better even though I didn't know what was happening to me. So I researched about changes I could make (apart from exercise) to alleviate my symptoms, particularly inflamation. I began changing my food and began acupuncture treatment. My symptoms began to improve and slowly but surely I recovered. I'm not totally fine, but compared to how I was back then I'm much better. The last thing my pcp suggested was to search for a geneticist. I don't know if that's what I need or if I will receive some answers from genetic testing. Also, I'm afraid of the costs.

Now with all the things going on with COVID-19 and lock down my symptoms are starting to come back. I've been sick constantly with colds and fatigued. I've been managing it like always but I need peace and need answers. I need to know what is wrong so I can make informed decisions, so I can receive treatment, so I can go on with my life, so I can have a better quality of life. 

I'm sorry for the long story but I tried to explain everything chronologically so you can understand better. If you have any suggestions or something to bring any light to my case I would appreciate it. I'm going to start searching for new specialists when things get better.",550,291,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/gizqg9/no_one_knows_what_is_wrong_with_me_i_really_need/

Also maybe some juvenile idiopathic arthritis triggered by Dengue. In any way, all your symptoms are more likely caused by some autoantiinflammatory diseases (even Lupus).

Look into:
1. Connective tissue disorders (there are hundreds)
2. Autoimmune issues
3. Endocrine problems
4. Genetics (like actual DNA, not just making conclusions from observations of family members).

Look especially at where these all *intersect*. For example, some connective tissue problems are genetic, but are affected (triggered or exacerbated) by environmental factors such as illness, hormones, and stress. 

I would consider finding a new PCP who is an internal medicine doctor, and saying upfront that you have been dealing with ongoing issues for many years and would like to discuss seeing a geneticist. Gather all your records *prior* to your first appointment (add your own concise summary if you can), and be a consistent advocate for yourself. I know it’s exhausting. 

Picture the medical establishment as a granite boulder sitting on top of the answers you need. You need to be a steady stream of water trickling down on the top of it. It will seem like nothing is happening, but eventually that boulder will look like a doughnut, and you’ll be able to look through it to find your answers.",119,0,

My father in law has been sick recently and was sent home on hospice. He has diabetes and about a month ago had a leg amputated above the knee. He has osteomyelitis, pneumonia, MDRO, UTI, and 50% injection rate after a mild heart attack (2 months ago). Last week he was transferred to the ICU from a rehab facility. He was on a ventilator and receiving dialysis daily. He was on a few blood pressure medications and 2-3 antibiotics for his multiple infections. They told us that the prognosis was not good and recommended hospice. Our goal was to get him home to pass with family surrounding him. They doctors had told us that they tried to take him off of the vent the day before and he couldn’t tolerate it longer than an hour. They were saying that there was a good chance that he would not be able to make it through the transport home because he couldn’t be transported without the vent. So on Friday they took him off of the vent and he made it home. Once home they took him off of IV Levophed. They were expecting him to pass shortly after. However this didn’t happen. 

Now, 6 days later, he is still alive and in good spirits. He has refused any pain medication and says he doesn’t have any pain. His lungs still sound really bad and he’s requiring frequent suction because he’s coughing up a lot. His o2 saturation has been in the upper 90s. His BP and heart rate are low (couldn’t give you exact readings). 

I’m just confused about all of this. They weren’t expecting him to even make it home. He made it and he’s still alive 6 days later. I understand that he is most likely going to pass soon. I’m not in denial about that. I’m just confused as to why he has lasted this long. He was requiring dialysis daily. I figured after a few days he would have passed. I feel almost guilty like we should have waited before making the choice to take him home on hospice. I feel like he might have had a chance for even a slight improvement to give him more time. I guess what I’m trying to understand is, they told us he was in critical condition and was going to die very very soon, as in most likely the same day he gets home. Is the fact that he’s still alive indicative of any improvement or proof that he wasn’t as sick as they thought he was?

We see these kinds of situations all the time.  The criteria to qualify for hospice is not that the patient is expected to die immediately (and, frankly, at that point it really defeats the purpose of hospice), but that, if the patient's disease runs it's expected course, the patient likely has 6 months or less left to live. It doesn't mean that the patient will definitely die in six months, but it's based on the referring physician's medical judgment. 

Patients come home on hospice and the idea is that we try to make the most of the time they have left, as well as managing any symptoms they have.  Oftentimes, a patient's routine medications that are not helping symptom-wise are discontinued.  Many times, patients feel better after stopping some meds that can have uncomfortable side effects.  We also work with a hospice pharmacist to treat symptoms and the medications we use can greatly improve a patient's overall well-being. Sometimes patients feel better just getting out of the hospital and being at home with family.  

We currently have some patients who have been on hospice for more than a year.  We've had patients in the past who have done so well that they've been discharged from hospice.  

It sounds to me like your situation is one where the medical team had determined there really isn't anything more they can do to try treat/cure the underlying illness so they recommended that he go home and be made as comfortable as possible. Of course, specific questions should be directed to the treating physicians but your hospice nurses are also a good resource for answers as to what his current condition is.

Weight: 1lb 10oz at birth, now 3lbs

Meds: Fentanyl & Lasix

He has yet to properly poop. He had a few MLs of breastmilk in his first few days of life but stopped when the first bowel movement never came. He's been on TPN only ever since.

He had necrotizing entercolitis by 2 weeks old that caused a perforation in his large intestine. They surgically repaired it and created stomas for an ostomy. He's never had more than a few poop smears and tiny ""seeds"" come out. A week ago he passed a meconium plug out of his bum.

Now for the past few days his belly has become distended. They did a contrast&xray study that didn't show any blockages so they don't think an exploratory surgery would help. They are putting a medicine (I'm not sure the name at the moment) into his stoma to try to break up whatever might be in there and get things moving. That was started almost 24 hours ago and hasn't worked yet. They were previously just trying saline. They've also started an antibiotic in case the belly distention is another infection. So far the 24 hour culture result looks good, waiting on 48 hour.

He's been on a ventilator since birth and we can't feed him or start a course of steroids for his lungs until he poops. We really have to just keep waiting? This isn't normal even for a micropreemie, right?

* Does he have a PDA/how large?  Have they tried closing it, and with what?  Why did he deliver early (maternal vs baby reason?)

No, this is not normal, by a long shot, for a micropreemie.  I am also extremely concerned about a lot of different factors, but his lungs and gut are pretty darn high on that list.

I am guessing that they are putting mucomyst in the stoma to try and break up anything in there, but I'm concerned for why he needs that.

**Summary/tl;dr - Panic attacks with neurological symptoms:**

Reddit, I'm at the end of my fucking rope. Medical professionals are calling my bf's symptoms panic attacks, but I'm convinced he needs a neurologist. I'm a research scientist in mental health (i.e. not a doctor), and my gut keeps telling me something is very wrong. What do you think?

Bf is currently experiencing “panic attacks” that he barely remembers after they finish. They last 3-6 hours, occur on more than half of the days in a week, and are characterized by extreme anxiety and neurological symptoms such as loss of balance, slurred and slowed speech, mental confusion, memory loss, rapid eye saccades side to side, fainting, and vomiting.

**Background:**

He has a history of childhood abuse and neglect and in general hasn't  seen doctors in his lifetime. Before this started, he had no known conditions but did have a history of anxious and depressive symptoms since adolescence. He's of south asian descent, 5'10, aprox 150lbs, is on 100mg of lyrica, smokes nicotine (\~10 cigarettes a day), 4-7 drinks a week, no other drug use.

**Early 2021 - Symptoms begin:**

He started losing his balance and slurring his speech in the last year, usually either after something extremely stressful (covid and unemployment really got to him) combined with having a beer or two. I thought it was his alcohol tolerance changing with age, so I wasn't too worried. He had several bad falls because of this, broke his glasses twice, needed stitches, etc... stressful but not concerning.

**June 2021 - Symptoms worsen:**

He finally got a job in April, he was super happy. It was a bit stressful and outside his field and had a huge learning curve, but he loved it. But he started losing his balance and slurring his speech more often, even when he hadn't had a drop of alcohol. He also started having full blown panic attacks, where he couldn't breathe, would vomit repeatedly, thought he was dying... I used grounding and breathing techniques to help him through

**July 2021 - Psychiatric emergency room:**

In early July, he couldn't keep food down for 6 days straight and alternated crying and panic attacks. The slurred speech and loss of balance continued. I took him to psychiatric emergency in my city where he was diagnosed with an anxiety disorder and put on a low dose (25mg) of seroquel/quetiapine. He was put on sick leave from his job. He was matched with a local psychiatrist, so switched him from seroquel to 50 mg lyrica (~~gabapentin~~ pregabalin\~\~)\~\~ that eventually increased to 150mg.

**August 2021 - Regular emergency room:**

Worst night. After feeling suicidal for the first time in years, he suddenly crashed face first into our shoe rack. Busted his nose open, black eye, full shebang. He was on his back and semi conscious, and couldn't speak. No asymmetry in smile etc but 911 operator and ambulance both suspected a stroke. He got carried out on a stretcher, down the stairs, rushed to ER, and kept for 2 days. He doesn't remember any of this except waking up in the hospital (but he was conscious and speaking/attempting to speak).

MRI negative for stroke, EEG negative for seizure, bloodwork normal. Given one dose of ativan, discharged, told it was ""bad anxiety"", and to keep seeing his psychiatrist.

**Sept 2021-present: medical incompetence??? :**

He saw his psychiatrist 3 days after he was released from the ER. Doc kept him on Lyrica 150 and said ER wasn't concerning since all tests were normal. Asks why bf doesn't want to go back to work yet/is reluctant to extend sick note. Doc refuses to put him on waitlists for therapy, other modalities at the psychiatric hospital, etc... because it's ""not that bad"".

My bf quit his job last week, since he faints at least weekly, vomits 2-3 times a week, and gets these ""panic attacks"" every other day at least (we're currently on day 4 of a long storm).

Second appointment was Tuesday. Doc decided to lower lyrica to 100mg (???) and prescribed Silexan, **a lavender oil extract(?!?!?!)** available from natural food stores. Not available to buy in my country. No pharmacist near us has heard of it. Doc still refuses to do anything else and outright refused ativan when my bf asked for it because it's ""not serious enough"". Next appointment is in over a month. Bf was on the floor half an hour ago and unable to get up.

**Where I'm stuck:**

We're stuck in a loop of ""well, he has a doctor, so go see him"" whenever we consult a nurse, ER, clinic, etc... and a doctor that isn't taking this seriously. We're in Canada (Quebec) with no family doctor and current doc and er won't refer to a neurologist. We've tried putting in a doctor change request but in a strained system it's not going through. I've reached out to work colleagues within mental health research and they can't help/shuttle him in anywhere. Bf is struggling with feeling suicidal/like a burden and I'm scared all the time.

**What I need from you:**

Docs of reddit, what is this!? What do I do??  I'm fucking terrified and I don't think I'm over reacting. Any insight or suggestions are very welcomed.

\[edited to include more background info\]

**2021/11/01 Update:**

 we spent the night at the hospital. I got video footage at home, wheeled him in a wheelchair into the ER. He couldn't keep his head up, was drooling, etc... ER didn't believe me he didn't take anything. He had dramatic short term memory problems for hours in the ER (didn't know where he was, kept asking for food even though he wasn't allowed, etc...).

They took blood and urine and did an ekg. All came back negative that I know of. I was kicked out of the room twice for privacy (once being after I asked about a neurology referral) and my bf doesn't remember much of what they told him beyond ""go to therapy and maintain a good lifestyle"". I did ask if they'd considered porphyria (I tried!) but wasn't able to insist they write down the neurology refusal.

Anyway reddit: **thanks for the insights**. You've all been super helpful. The plan now is to request a psych change and try to get a neurology referral from either the new psychiatrist or from a walk in/urgent care clinic.

An EEG has to capture one of these episodes to have a sense of what is going on. Without video of what happened, either on its own or ideally with simultaneous EEG (vEEG), it's very hard to assess neurologically.

What you're describing isn't panic attacks; those have classic presentations, and this isn't it. The attacks could be ""functional neurological symptom disorder"" or ""conversion disorder"" or ""\[psychogenic\] non-epileptic seizures"" or ""nonepileptic paroxysmal events""—there are a lot of words for seizure-like episodes that do not involve abnormal electrical activity in the brain—but that requires simultaneous imaging to determine. They could also could still be epileptic seizures, maybe; it's not exactly clear to me how medical workup went.

Either way, this psychiatrist is practicing in a way that would be highly idiosyncratic in the US. Quetiapine isn't first line for anxiety. Neither is pregabalin, and it isn't first line for most seizures, either. Silexan has only very preliminary evidence for being effective.

What's needed more than anything else is a second opinion, both psychiatric and neurological. It sounds like there are serious practical barriers to getting that, but that's what's needed. At the very least clear indication of why this has all been on psychiatry based on the prior workup.",347,0,

4 weeks ago from today I was going to the gym with my friend and I suddenly looked at him and was like “man I am really having a hard time breathing”. I only did about half a workout then left due to really affecting me. I rested over the weekend and felt better by Monday morning. I went to work as usual for the next 2 days until it came back Wednesday.

It lasted a week consistently everyday all day until I had enough and figured something was wrong. I initially thought covid although I had no other symptoms. I went to patient first late in the evening. They covid tested me did a chest X-ray and an ekg. Everything came back normal except for the ekg which showed I had a right bundle branch block. They recommended I go to the ER because of the symptoms and what they had found.

I went straight to the ER from there and they repeated the ekg to which they found the same right bundle branch block. They did basic blood work and repeated the X-ray to which they found nothing abnormal. They referred me to a cardiologist and discharged me.

A few days later I made the appointment with the cardiologist. They repeated the ekg there as well and came back with the same result. He ordered an ultrasound of my heart and a stress test. Also he referred me to a pulmonary doctor. I have completed both the ultrasound and stress test everything came back normal.

I made the appointment with the pulmonary doctor. The first visit was a tele visit and she ordered a CT scan. I went and did that and everything came back normal. I had a follow up appointment in the office the next week and they did a spirometry test. She told me the test was abnormal on the part where I exhaled. She prescribed me Advair Diskus 250/50 and I have been using that twice a day for a week and a half now. It has not helped at all. I have a follow up in a few weeks to do more tests apparently.

I made an appointment with my primary care doctor 2 days ago. He prescribed me Prednisone, zpack, and ventolin (inhaler) to try and knock anything out. This is my first day taking it. He also ordered a blood count test and thyroid test. I am waiting on the results

To go into more of my symptoms. I have a very hard time getting air and getting the feeling of getting a full breathe when I do breathe in. My mouth locks open a lot trying to yawn to get in air and it normally takes about 5-10 of those before I get the feeling of a full breath. I also have a decent amount of chest tightness and pain under my left peck on the bottom swoop part of it. 

It is absolutely miserable. I am going to lose my job because of how much I have had to miss work. I am exhausted all the time and honestly quite scared. I did before this smoke marijuana on occasion 1-2 times a week max (if that) but obviously have completely stopped since this has happened. I also take Lexapro daily and have been on that for 2 years +. If there are any tests I should do or any type of recommendation at all I will absolutely try it. I am desperate at this point  and don’t know what to do (plus no one really seems to care / have any type of urgency to get it resolved)

Thank you so much for any and all responses. I truly truly appreciate it

EDIT: Wow everyone. Thank you so so so much I am completely shocked at how much support I have received here. I truly appreciate each and every one of you who have made a contribution to try and help me. It’s a very scary time and I’m very lost so reading all these really put a smile on my face. I will absolutely follow up with everything suggested here

EDIT 2: I also wanted to mention the ONLY other symptom I have been experiencing is eye pain. Especially in the morning. Also after working out when washing my hands I noticed my eyes were blood shot red in the mirror. I have been working out consistently for years now and have never seen that. This did start before any of the other stuff did however but I figured it was worth mentioning.

My lovely dad (60 y.o male, 5'10"" tall, 78 kg weight, doesn't smoke and doesn't drink, previously had Hepatitis B) who's always been my role model and hero in life got diagnosed with sarcamatoid carcinoma starting from liver and spread all over his body (Stage 4 liver cancer). It started when a careless doctor performed a blood transfusion when my dad had an accident a few years ago and needed operation on his leg and the injected blood had a virus for Hepatitis B. We believe the cancer cells come from this liver infection of Hep B.

He currently has Jaundice and a bloated stomach and cancer treatment can't start unless Jaundice goes away first. The doctor told him about his diagnosis and he seems to have lost all his fight. How do I help him feel better? I can't think straight but I want to do anything and everything I possibly can to help him get through this. The doctor's plan is to cure the Jaundice ASAP and start chemo treatment.

He too was 60. I am going to be frank with you , stage 4 is not optimistic.

My dad was able to survive 5 years post stage 3 diagnosis because he qualified for some experimental treatment back then. I recall it was call radioembolization where they use a minimally invasive method to attack the cancer tissue with minimal impact to his healthy tissues. He was able to keep an active life up till the point his cancer metastatasized and spread everywhere. 

I am not sure about your dad's condition but you can always ask about experimental treatment options.


But the most important thing i am going to say is to not force your dad to fight it. Let him know that everything is going to be okay and he should choose on his own whether he wants to fight. Cancer is a painful battle and of all the pain one has to endure, you don't get a lot of time or quality of life out of it. Respect his decision. 


When a loved one gets a cancer diagnosis we often forget the most important thing is to spend the most time we have left with them instead of just trying to extend their time. If you work outside of your hometown, quit that job and come home because you will regret the time lost making memories but you will not regret the lost potential income. If you are studying out of state, transfer back home and spend time with your dad. Tell him everything you want to tell him, ask him about his stories. Be patient with him because cancer is painful and it is very difficult for a patient to maintain mental calm. Bear with him.

Make sure he has got his affairs in order especially his will and distribution of assets.

Sex- female

Race -white

Duration of complaint- lasted about a month or two

Location- Texas / Colorado

This happened back in the 90’s, and recently told some coworkers about it and they were floored. I didn’t think much of it, and thought it would be a common occurrence for humans but now that I’m researching it, I can’t find much about it online.   

We were on vacation and she went snorkeling off the coast around some modern shipwreck. She tried to pull off some pieces of the ship and scraped her arm pretty bad. She complained about the pain the first two days and at some point on the trip the growth started. She said she could feel them moving or tunneling in her skin. It took weeks for her to get it resolved since we lived in a landlocked state and doctors had no clue how to deal with something like this. She eventually found someone that had her soak her arm in something to get them off/kill them. 

I don’t understand how they can live on a human body, and how would this type of issue be resolved today?

UPDATE: called my mom and dad today and confirmed on facetime that we didn’t have a group hallucination. My mom, who is a nurse, said she spoke to countless colleagues and doctors she worked with who confirmed they were barnacles by observation but had no fixes or explanation. She said she met a nurse who was from Florida who was familiar with the situation and told her to “soak it in something, I don’t remember what. It was something crazy like turpentine or something”. She said the shell like structures around the creatures disintegrated and she was able to firmly scrub that off. She still has little white dot scars all over her arms from the lil roommates.

>had barnacles growing from her arm. How is that medically possible?

Briefly, it isn't possible, and she didn't have barnacles growing on her or in her.

While there are some parasites that grow under the skin, and even move, these are not.found in ocean water.

The possibilities are: 

+ She had a parasite such as botfly that she got from visiting a tropical area, and it has nothing to do with the shipwreck
+ She did did not have a parasite moving under her skin. Just because you feel like something is moving under your skin does not necessarily mean that something is.

I don't know if this is still relevant for a mental health related question, but Im 17M about 120 lbs and 5'1"". 

I have been told by a doctor I may have ocd and general anxiety but have never been medicated. I have never done recreational drugs, never had alcohol. I've had some recurring issues with low blood sugar and low iron.

I would say this has been happening to me for about 6 months. From time to time, I will see a person who is not physically present. For example I will be walking and see a woman across the street, I will be absolutely sure she is there, and then she will walk behind a pillar or stop sign and just disappear. 

I have had friends and family witness this happening too, but  usually I have been able to reason with myself by saying the person just turned down a corner or went a different way. 

Yesterday though, I saw a man walking directly towards me and then disappear. I know that I definitely saw him because I moved out of the way and stepped off the sidewalk in doing so. When I looked up after moving, he was no longer there. The only place he could have gone is the forest nearby, but there is a steep incline, the trees and bushes are thin and I would have seen / heard him. It was broad daylight around 2 pm, not dark or foggy at all.

Initially I remembered what this man looked like but I'm starting to forget, it feels almost ""blurry"" in my mind. This has been causing me to worry all day and I haven't slept. I usually feel sick when I'm anxious but, in addition to that, I have pain in my chest, a sinking sensation and the feeling that I'm in danger when I think about this incident. 

If it matters, I have prescription glasses which I wasn't wearing at the time, but the man was about 5 metres away and I am absolutely sure that I saw him there. I think I was a bit dehydrated and hungry since I'd been walking for some time but I don't know if that can cause hallucinations. I don't have a family history of schizophrenia, psychosis or anything similar.

This started as a funny story for me but I'm now legitimately fearful because of this experience. I am constantly trying to rationalize it in my head but can't come up with anything.

I would appreciate if someone could throw in their two cents here and let me know if there's any possible medical explanation for this. Thank you

Would appreciate it if u read this and the update which is after the gastroenterology appointment I had today. 

----

I am desperate and I am broken.

I'm not gonna lie, this is literally my last hope.

Basics: I am a (formerly very health and active) 23yr old woman. My mother is white Jewish Dutch my father is Haitian/Cherokee. I normally weigh about 130lb and am 5'7"" tall. Because of this sickness I have lost 16lb and am around 114 currently and STILL LOOSING weight because of this. 

I DO NOT smoke. 

I DO NOT drink. 

I DO smoke weed. (gotten more then on occasion, this is explained in symptoms explication) 

This has been going on, now, for 8 MONTHS. 

I should make something clear first. I am SCARED OF DR'S. So this means that I have avoided them other then a needed check up till I was 18 like the plauge. So the fact I've been going to the Dr a lot as of late says a LOT about how bad I feel. My Dr's fucking know this. 

I have Major Depressive Disorder and Anxiety and have always had problems asserting myself, but I've been really trying hard with my Dr's. 

Now to the Symptoms:
Long story short, it started with me getting VERY sick in the mornings. NO VOMITING ONLY diarrhea. Lots of it. Every morning at 6. It became more and more painful and soon I couldn't sleep because of the pain. 

I went to my PCP. She listened and checked me over and gave me some pills to take. Imodium. It didn't work. Just made it more painful because now I had to strain. 

I went back. She gave me more pills. These ones to try and make my intestines go slower. 

They didn't work. 

I went back. She gave me different pills that did the same thing. 

It didn't work. 

During this whole time my symptoms are the same if not worse. Slowly I'm being worn down. I'm getting 4hrs of sleep at best and slowly starting to lospe weight. 

I'm beginning to loose my ability to homd down food. 

In desperation I turn to smoking weed to be able to eat. 

This works. I tell my PCP this. She doesn't care. She thinks I'm exaggerating. You can tell she thinks on just some druggie and this is all caused by the weed, ignoring that I DID NOT SMOKE OFTEN AT ALL before these symptoms started making eating next to impossible. 

Incase you're wondering. Trying to eat is like having a vat of angry acid instead of a stomach, and even putting water in it makes it ANGRY. Putting food in it leaves me with severe nauseous and actively gaging for HOURS from one SMALL BITE, without weed. 

No matter how I explained my 8 outta ten pain in the mornings and Ina ukity to eat. I was ignored. 

She dinally lamented and gave me a stool sample test and blood work. I was told my blood work was normal with 'high white blood cells but that's normal for you' and there was NOTHING WRONG with my stool samples. 

During this all I was on the B. R. A. T. diet too to try and see if that would help. 

It didn't. 

It all came to a head April 3rd when I was rushed to the er. My white blood cells were off the charts. They finally gave me A CAT scan. I had appendicitis. Chronic appendicitis. 

I thought this was it, I'd be free finally. 

I was wrong. 

I wasn't given the appendectomy. Because the infection was cured after the first day in the hospital. 

The symptoms restarted 2 days after I got out, and got acute QUICKLY. 

Within 2 weeks I was back with the same symptoms, begging for death. 

They finally lament and take out my massively thickened around the middle appendix, which was also so large it shoved my uterus to the left side and had been BLOCKING (literally) my shit all day, which is why It all evacuated in the mornings after I layed down for a few hours. It was infected because shit kept getting into it. Literally. 

As they were in there they looked around and I was also diagnosed with endometriosis, without a douot, and possibly polycystic overy, there was a MASSIVE one the size of two ovaries combined on my right one. 

One would think that this would finally be the end... But it's still somehow not. 

I'm currently 5 days out of surgery. I hate narcotics so I begrudgingly accepted 10 to bring home, just incase, and have used 2 so far. One because, in a perfect storm, my period started on my second day pitta surgery and basically incompasitated me on the bathroom floor till I managed to swollow one. 

I'm not concerned about pain caused by my period. I now know why that's absolutely mind numbing. 

It's day 5 now and my period calms down after 3 days so that pain is mostly just back pain. 

The diarrhea hasn't stopped and is now MORE PAINFUL SOMEHOW. And it starts at 5am now instead of 6. I get about 3hrs of sleep every night before I have to wake up and shit for HOURS in AGONY and then curl up in bed literally begging someone to kill me while it feels like someone is taking my I testines and twisting them around with a garden hoe. 

I can't fucking eat anymore. 

I try and swallow even WATER and it feels like someone put a stone jn my stomach and I have to wait in a. Good amount of pain before I am allowed one small sip again and then must go through the pain again. If I try and drink more the a  small sip, I'd best be prepared for 'actually please shoot me in the head I don't want to live anymore' pain for HOURS. 

Food is the same but worse because it gets digested and that's absolouet agony. 

Today I've been awake since 5am, it's 9am. I'm still in the bathroom, in pain, and I have a GI appointment at 11:45. 

If he doesn't listen to me, and tells me I'm lying, or doesn't listen ebcause I'm 23 or anything else... I don't know what to do. 

The pain is too much now. I refuse to become dependent on narcotics while still having the same symptoms. 

I am ready to kill myself. 

I have a plan. 

But before I do, I trying to give Dr's one last chance. That chance is today at noon. Maybe they'll listen to me today. 

I douot it. But before I inivitable am told my pain isn't valid because I'm a woman, I offer my story to you, Dr's of reddit.... 

Do you have any ideas? Or many suggestions on how to get drs to listen to me or take me seriously? 

I'm at my wits end. This is my last resort and I'm so sorry to put this on you amazing people of reddit... But I'm desperate, and don't know what else to do. 

I think I've said everything, but if anyone has questions PLEASE ask and I'll answer asap. I'm on mobile. So sorry for typos. 

I will edit after the GI appointment. 

Thank you for any suggestions or advice.",504,167,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/bgg8f9/drs_keep_ignoring_me_saying_im_23_and_all_my/

297,Comment,bgg8f9,Dr's keep ignoring me saying I'm 23 and all my symptoms are caused because I 'must drink and smoke weed all the time' (I DON'T). I'm broken at at my wits end. Please help?,RZoroaster,Physician - Emergency Medicine,2019-04-23 15:13:50,"I'm an emergency medicine doctor. I'm not the one who fixes these problems usually but I've seen a lot of patients in various stages of the process you are going through now.  In fact I read most of this wondering if you were a patient I saw just two days ago.  Almost all patient in a situation like yours get a diagnosis and get back to a normal life.  It can be a long road but you still have a lot of options.

&#x200B;

First, if you are feeling suicidal and you have a plan you should go to the Emergency department immediately.  I realize this is incredibly distressing but it is temporary, and believe it or not it sounds like you are actually moving towards a diagnosis.  Do not make a permanent decision about a temporary problem, no matter how severe it is.  The ED can get you emergency psychiatric care to get you out of this dangerous place.

&#x200B;

Along those same lines you have a lot of reason to be hopeful here.  If they found PCOS and endometriosis when they took out your appendix, well those are both things that can cause a lot of severe abdominal pain and it sounds like you're only in the beginning stages of working those up.  I'm not going to promise that it will be quick because these things unfortunately take a lot of time to dig into but there are lots of potential treatments for both of these conditions that can make a big difference.  

&#x200B;

Also, you are just starting out with the gastroenterologist.  There are many tests that they have access to that are critical here like colonoscopy, endoscopy, gastric emptying studies, etc.  If you have Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis or Cyclic vomiting syndrome or gastroparesis these are the people who will be able to diagnose it.  But they are not going to be able to figure it out in one visit.  I promise you that.  Remember GI docs have seen it all.  They are not going to be surprised or shocked by these symptoms, it doesn't mean they don't care, it's just that they see this sort of thing very frequently.  And if they don't order every possible test right off the bat it doesn't mean they aren't taking you seriously.  There is a rationale for why they work through things in a stepwise fashion.  Order certain tests before you've ruled out other things and those tests are not as informative.  I realize it's hard to be patient when you're in as much discomfort as you are but you are on the right track.

&#x200B;

And please ignore people who tell you to lie to your doctor or exaggerate your symptoms!!!  This is the worst thing you can do.  I know it's tempting when you feel like you aren't being taken seriously but for patients in your situation the single most important thing for you is to have a relationship of trust with a good GI specialist.  A relationship of trust is a two way street.  If you are honest and straightforward with them then they will trust you when you say that things aren't working and they will continue working with you.   I had a patient recently who told me she had lost 60 lbds in the last two months.  I looked in the chart and she had actually lost 10.  She told me she had tried a bunch of different medications for this that she hadn't actually tried, and she told me she had been admitted for something when it had actually been for something else.  Of course I still treated her.  Of course I still did my best to help her.  But it is honestly much harder for me to know what is the best test to order next when I don't know what is true and what is not.  People underestimate how important the history is to a physician in their decision-making and when we don't know if the things you've told us are accurate it actually makes the job much harder.  So honesty is the best policy.  Lying might get you more tests up front, but this is not a one visit diagnosis.  You need a GI who trusts you and who you trust and who will work with you nonstop until this is figured out.  

&#x200B;

Finally, I'll just reiterate once more that if you are truly feeling suicidal you should seek help for that immediately.  That is the disease talking, not you.  And the disease will be discovered and treated.  Don't let it take your life in the meantime.",321,0,

-What I guess is mildly slurred speech for weeks (saying “blutter” instead of butter or combining words on accident “irontamin” instead of “iron vitamin”. Happens frequently.)

-Fatigue

-Headaches

-Worsening vision in one eye, occasionally seeing a “sparkle” or little blip of light

-Poor memory (Sometimes forgetting things in under 2-3mins)

-Poor spatial awareness (running in to walls, chairs, hitting my feet on things)

-Sudden loss of balance (crossing feet)

-Sudden extreme depression/anxiety (Fits of “mania”? Laughing and crying at the same time uncontrollably, had my first panic attack a week ago and it was very extreme.)

-Now, for the past 9hrs my face from the forehead down is numb and tingling with a pins and needle sensation.

My family started acting weird doing weird things condemning me for doing things I haven't done sometimes right after they have done them to me. I 've been to 2 mental hospitals.

So, my gf caught ""Dengue"" A few days back and she got admitted to hospital. Me and my gf live long distance and the only way for me to know what is happening her texting me about what is happening. So few days back she had dengue and was admitted to a hospital, she said they are giving blood...

So today i got a call from her that she is in a critical condition and her platelet count is going down day by day and doctors are transfusing platelets to her(i don't how to say this) and her current platelet count is 4000, so she said the doctors are saying ""she is critical and we have to wait and see"".

Till now this is the info i know, so please can anyone tell me will she survive i am really scared me and my gf are of same age 18.

Please anyone tell me what is happening there i can't understand...

Thank you.

EDIT: My gf is talking very well in calls right now, however her platelet count hasnt improved but the way she is talking seems like she will get through it and i hope she does...

EDIT 2- SHE  is in critical condition shifted to another hospital in another city it's by far the biggest one so doctors said we just have to hope that she gets better.😕

EDIT 3- HER platelets count fell to 600(not 6 misheard on phone) , doctors say that they are trying their best..

EDIT 4- her platelets are fluctuating ......they are running some test called as ""blood culture test"".

I finally got a diagnosis in the emergency room after bawling my eyes out of frustration at this entire situation and they found out I have a coronary vasospasm and two additional PEs on my right lung. I’m relieved we finally can treat this and find the cause. I’m eternally grateful to a cardiologist that commented here with this suggestion because I fought for myself tonight. 


Edit #2: I finally got a referral over to a cardiologist. After talking to my rheumatologist he doesn’t believe it’s anxiety related as we’ve tried SSRIs and Valium. He believes it’s either a heart condition, inflammation around the heart and breastbone or an issue with my gallbladder. Due to how deliberating my symptoms are he recommended we start with a cardiologist to rule out the more serious stuff and go from there. My appointment by some miracle is on Friday and I will keep everyone posted. 

Edit#1 with additional info: met with a therapist weekly for three months and got placed on anti anxiety medications by a psychiatrist, this hasn’t alleviated symptoms. Heart problems do run in my family. A cousin of mine passed away from heart failure at 23 at was missed when I was a kid and my mother has a rare heart defect she didn’t get diagnosed with until she was 29. 

I’m a 25 year old female, 5’10 200lbs with diagnosed Lupus and PCOS. I’m on methotrexate to manage my Lupus and am on metformin for PCOS. No history or family history of diabetes, blood tests have confirmed everything is in a normal range. I did a round of warfarin to treat a small blood clot (pulmonary embolism) they found the third time I went to the ER and on my last ER visit it was no longer there. 

All of my blood work has come back in normal ranges for blood sugar and cholesterol along with troponin and when I got cardiac imaging done three of the four times the attending ER physicians told me that my heart was pumping blood “excellently” and that they couldn’t find anything wrong with my heart. We did a chest ultrasound that looked normal and my CT scan looked normal as well, apart from discovering a very small PE the third time that had been previously missed. They have also run tests to rule out GERD and we even tried a brief stint with anti anxiety medications that didn’t make a difference - I don’t believe that I suffer from anxiety as I do not have any of the other symptoms, this is the one thing in my life causing me a tremendous amount of stress. 

The problem is, I can’t shake the feeling that somethings seriously wrong and that no one is taking a closer look because of my age. I’m really worried I’m having heart issues that are being missed and that I’m going to die from them. 

Each time I’ve had one of these episodes, I get a crushing feeling in my chest and back, feel like I have an elephant sitting on me and caving in my chest along with serious lower back pain that’s deliberating. I then start to get numb fingers in my left arm and feel an impending sense of doom. I’ve gotten super lethargic before one of these attacks and have slept for upwards of 10 hours. They also result in dizziness and shakiness where I feel cold and line I can’t get warm enough. Lastly, I sometimes get a sharp pain in my upper left chest and middle chest area that almost feels like I’m getting shocked by electricity. They usually come and go for a few days before I get worried enough to go to the emergency room and then get sent home being told they can’t find anything. 

Can someone please help me? I’ve been unable to get a recommendation for a cardiologist as my insurance requires a recommendation as the ER hasn’t been able to pinpoint anything heart related. I’m having the same symptoms again and don’t want to go to the hospital unprepared for what to ask for to be taken seriously as I’m so nervous of just getting sent home again.

As much as I love peaches, this can’t be normal. 

He has episodes of confusion, memory loss, and lethargy. His mood is also affected, he gets extremely negative. Sometimes they escalate into dizzy / blackout spells, which resolve after sitting down and having a snack and water.

No official diagnoses because he really doesn’t like hospitals and medical procedures. Doesn’t drink often, no drugs, not much exercise other than running after a toddler all day.

About 6 years ago he had an infected wound and had to take a heavy dose of antibiotics: that’s when the issues started. He had urinary and gut problems immediately after the antibiotics. A few months later, very suddenly, he started losing consciousness whenever he ate high glycemic index foods. Eventually we managed that with very slow reintroduction to complex carbohydrates and a B complex multivitamin. (Thiamine malabsorption?). The hospital didn’t find anything wrong: he walked out after blood tests and an EKG came back “normal” and he felt “fine”. Family doctors suggested hormonal tests (which we did and came back normal) or something something pancreas. This was all a few years ago so I don’t remember the details: I just know that there was no indication that something was wrong.

He generally feels better when he takes a B complex / multivitamin, but he doesn’t want to take them daily and wants to solve it with more natural solutions like diet or fixing his gut microbiome. Doesn’t want to spend money or time on this, just ignore it, eat an apple a day, and keep going. But I can’t ignore it: the bed stinks of peaches.

After a few months of dry bedsheets, he’s starting to sweat at night and black out in the day again. He’s not taking vitamins but he says “I’m eating lots of meat, I should have enough thiamin.”

I’m worried about his health and want to help him, but I know he has some level of medical trauma that makes him turn into a wall when I mention checking anything. What could it be? Where can I even start? I would really appreciate any advice.


UPDATE: We talked about it, showed him this post, and went to buy a glucose tester. We’ll go get an appointment on Monday (soonest possible) so hopefully he’ll get an appointment next week. Thank you everyone for the advice!

UPDATE 2 & Q: Since last night his blood glucose readings have been 88 (hungry/dizzy), 104 (1h after meal), 99 (waking up). I’m NAD but that doesn’t seem high? We’ll have to wait for a night sweat.

Hello friends.

We are in a complete crisis in the family. Will try to be brief but any help is appreciated.

We noticed that our five-year-old was squinting very slightly in one eye. We booked an appointment at the health center and got to see a doctor quickly. The doctor thought everything looked fine except for a slight squint in one eye. We get a referral to the eye clinic. 4 days after the referral I notice by chance that my son is not seeing. I cover the eye that doesn't squint and he fumbles in the dark. I panic, take the car and go to the emergency room.
We find out that our son has a damaged optic nerve and a scar on the retina. He therefore sees 0 in that eye. This will be an absolute nightmare for us. The damage must have occurred between January 1 and April 20. We have no idea.

A CT X-ray was done (everything looks fine)
Spinal cord test.
Blood samples
A number of eye examinations.


We are absolutely terrified that the other eye will disappear as well. Doctors give us no answers. We are waiting for an MRI but right now we don't know why this happened or where it came from.

It's probably far-fetched but maybe someone out there has suffered the same thing or has some tips and advice for us. I haven't been able to sleep for several nights and the fear that the healthy eye will disappear eats up my existence. Feeling so terribly bad. According to the doctor, nothing can be done about the lost eye.

Damn, what a darkness. What are we gona do?😔",488,133,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/12zww7v/my_five_year_old_son_got_blind_in_one_eye_please/

I know you are scared. I know you are hoping for any answer to try and figure out what is going on. My biggest piece of advice is please do not do anything without talking to your ophthalmologist (eye doc). What you are describing with damaged optic nerve and retinal scaring is some form of optic neuritis (fancy term for damaged nerve in the eye). This can be a very complex diagnosis in kids and can take time and a lot of tests to figure out the exact cause. I can promise you that you will not find the answers on Reddit. These conditions can be so rare that ophthalmologists (eye docs) will refer to more specialized ophthalmologists such as neuro-ophthalmologists or retina specialists to figure out what is going on. There is no way of knowing if the other eye could be impacted without figuring out the cause which takes time. I have worked with some of these specialists at my school and the process takes time to run the various tests and they discuss these cases in groups to come up with a diagnosis together. I can assure you they are doing everything they can to figure it out. I have seen first hand how concerned they get when a patient has lost vision in one eye and will do everything to try and protect the other eye. 
 
Again please do not take advice from Reddit regarding this. I know you are scared right now and you want to try anything and I see some comments saying “my kid had something like this too and XYZ worked” BUT DO NOT TRY ANYTHING WITHOUT TALKING TO YOUR EYE DOC! The information you have posted only gives us part of the picture and I promise you no doctor on here is going to be able to give you better advice than your eye doc.",492,0,

Canada, nonsmoker, history of OUD but sober for 5+ years

[Photos. Very NSFW, obviously](https://imgur.com/a/oBdsZXc)

Pitting edema of unknown cause, beginning at mid-low calves.

40mg vyvanse, 16mg buprenorphine daily
Bactrim 800mg/160mg BID

To start with, I made another post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/wx65k4/suffered_a_12cm_laceration_to_ankle_that_nearly/) but it didn't get any traction at all. I can be really wordy, especially when I'm anxious, but it provides a lot of background and obviously my suspicions were correct. the **tl;dr is I suffered a serious laceration during an accident, got staples, and now have an infection. The doctors I've seen have appeared unconcerned and I can't get any proper wound care instructions. Culture came back as ""heavy s. aureus growth"", ""heavy skin flora growth"" and ""minor gram negative bacteria growth"".**

Shortly after I made the post above, I went to the ER as I didn't think it could wait - the cellulitis had broken down quite a bit more and drained a huge amount and it looked like I had a small crater under the staples. The doctor described it as having drained, prescribed me cephalexin, and advised me to keep my appointment to have a look at the wound and have my staples out in a few days with my GP.

I live an an area with a severe doctor shortage - it's estimated about 50% of the population in my city can't find a GP due to it being an undesirable city and the province having essentially gone to war with physicians over compensation during the pandemic. On arrival at my doctor's office, I waited around two hours past my appointment time, and only got in because several people before me got angry and left.

On entering my room, my doctor just pointed at the table until I got on it and unwrapped my bandages. He stared at the infection for a few seconds from his desk before simply saying ""That's bad."" I asked if the wound had healed enough to take the staples out and he wordlessly removed them, then instructed me to rewrap the open wound with the bandage I had been wearing, despite it being soaked through with purulent exudate and having been left in a pile on the bed. I asked a number of questions about followups for diabetes (random blood sugars had been fine, but I have unexplained pitting edema) and about care, which he didn't respond to, as well as when I should schedule a followup appointment. I figured he was thinking and read over his shoulder a bit of his notes when he started typing, where he described it as ""Septic ++++++ ankle wound"". He then printed off a referral for a home care nurse and handed it to me without telling me what it was or how Homecare worked. I expected him to acknowledge or answer at least some of the things I'd asked about, but he just said ""Okay, we're done"" and gestured for me to leave. I repeated that I didn't know how to take care of the wound properly and he said ""I'm hoping they will help with that"" before turning away. The entire visit, I don't think he said more than 10 words collectively.

The wound continued to get worse while I waited for homecare to contact me. With the long weekend, I assumed it might be a few more days and went into the ER as the wound had turned black and continued to smell very bad and soak through my bandages daily. I was triaged for a good 6 hours and on arrival the doctor seemed to be nonplussed about why I had come in - I explained I was worried it wasn't healing and that I was now out of antibiotics. He gave me a prescription for a week of bactrim and had a wound culture performed. He advised me that it looked like it was too dry and had a nurse come in with an adhesive-backed padded dressing of some sort to keep it moist.

I still haven't been able to figure out what happened with my home care referral - I'm suspicious it never actually got faxed - so I left the dressing on for two days, figuring it was better to have a slightly older dressing than dry the wound out again. By the second day, it looked and smelled like a spoiled ground beef container, and I resorted to changing back to my sterile dressings. I was really shocked at how much more tissue had disintegrated and how deep the hole now is, and I'm worried that I might be very close to a point of no return. The wound smells so badly that it's the only thing I can smell most of the time, and it worries me that I have no pain, itching, or tingling, when I had all three for most of the time I was infected.

Am I overreacting to a bad looking infection that isn't as bad as I'd feared? Did I get a collection of bad doctor's visits? I don't know what to do besides continue to go back to the ER and try to work on 2 hours of sleep.

I am currently living in an absolute nowhere town where I have to drive at least 2 hours to get any sort of real healthcare.

I then went to a much further urgent care clinic because I called and they said they had mental health services that could help with depression. I went there and they took me to a room where an assistant asked questions. A doctor then entered and repeated those questions. When they realized I was not actively suicidal they told me they couldn't help me and let me go.

Urgent care can be the right place for depression, but that's predominantly for things like thoughts of self-harm or symptoms of a severe crisis.  I suspect that's what they assessed for with you.  An urgent care clinic would not be the right place to start an antidepressant, as there is specific follow-up and monitoring that should be done when starting these medications.  Simply having a psychiatrist or mental health services available at the facility doesn't change things in that regard.  

Overall, you were assessed by a medical provider.  With the current medical system in the USA that means you can be billed for the services (even if you walked out exactly as you walked in).  You can always contest the bill, complain to customer services, set up a payment plan, find an itemized list, etc, etc, etc -- I can't speak to being an expert on what happens on the billing side of things once the bill is issued -- but overall I think you're going to have a hard time avoiding a considerable amount of this bill.

Your best bet in the future is to find yourself a primary care provider who's nearby that can help with a broad range of your healthcare needs (including considering antidepressants and other treatment modalities for depression).",416,0,
333,Post,fbmmax,I've gone COMPLETELY deaf in one ear and the ER has told me they can do nothing to help. Where can I go to get help before permanent damage is done?,violaceous_trogon,This user has not yet been verified.,1583025789.0,"I posted about this last night. I didn't get any responses with helpful information, so I'm reposting the relevant info I gave then below. Since I made my first post, I've lost **ALL HEARING** in my right ear. I'm sorry if this isn't kosher, I'm just so afraid and frustrated and helpless. 

I'm a white American transgender woman (assigned male at birth, transitioning to female). I live in Ames, IA. I'm 24, am 5'11"" and weigh about 205 lbs. As a child, I had frequent ear infections and had to have tubes put in. I don't listen to loud music, am not exposed to loud noises in the course of my day, and don't go to any loud concerts. I take:

 • lamotrigine, as one 25 mg tablet once a day

 • estradiol, as one 2mg tablet sublingually twice a day

 • spironolactone, as one 100mg tablet twice a day

 • Wellbutrin XL, three 150mg tablets once a day

 • zyrtec, as one 10mg tablet once a day. 

I have been having constant ear problems for almost two months. I experienced sudden onset of tinnitus in my left ear on January 9th, and went to a doctor two days later. In those ensuing two days, i started to feel intermittent pain in both ears and light pressure. The doctor I saw diagnosed me with an ear infection, saying that my left eardrum was bulging but my right eardrum was fine. She prescribed me oral Doxycycline, which I started, but had a bad reaction (severe vomiting and an episode of extreme confusion) and stopped the course of antibiotics at the advice of a doctor. It took her 5 days to get back to me and prescribe another antibiotic, despite my constant calls; my ears continued to worsen and the ringing continued. She prescribed me oral Cefdinir, and over the 10-day course, I had no improvement. I took every dose exactly as directed. 

When I called the doctor who initially saw me (this was approx. January 26th), she said there was nothing more she could do to help and referred me to the ENT department at her clinic. Unfortunately, only one of the three ENTs at her clinic will accept adult patients, which meant the soonest I could see a specialist specialist was March 26th. I was outraged by this but I felt that there was little to nothing I could do. I resigned myself to hoping the symptoms would clear on their own, before late March.

That didn't happen. During the month of February, the pain became less frequent, but it was still there and continues to be there; I've had episodes of pain in both ears. When I first came down with this, the pain was dull, but it's become sharp and stabbing. I have constant ringing in my left ear, and intermittent ringing episodes in my right ear. I grudgingly accepted this, thinking that there was little I could do but wait. A few days ago, I started sneezing and developed a postnasal drip. A kid in one of my college classes who's been sneezing and coughing for a while coughed directly into my face shortly before the sneezing started, so I feel like that's likely why I'm sneezing.

On Thursday night, the hearing in my right ear went quiet. Not completely quiet, but significantly quieter than normal. This happened while I was reading. I wasn't doing anything out of the ordinary or exposed to loud noises. I consulted my girlfriend and Google, and concluded that my sudden hearing loss was a medical emergency and we went to the ER. They took me in, asked a few questions, and a doctor came. He seemed concerned not about my hearing, but the sneezing I've had for the past few days. He looked into my ears and noted fluid buildup in my left ear, but said nothing about my right ear, the one with hearing loss. He ordered a nose swab and wanted to check me for flu for some reason. He said that that was all he could do for me, because ""we treat heart attacks and stab wounds here, not hearing loss."" I tested negative for everything, and advised I try a nasal spray, wait until my specialist appointment in a month, and ""hope things don't get worse.""

My hearing hasn't come back. I called the doctor who first saw me for the ""ear infection,"" to ask if she could try to do something to get me in faster, but she won't be in her office for another 5 days. I asked to be put through to the ENT department, to notify them of the alarming development of my symptoms and to ask if I could be seen sooner than a month from now. The receptionist told me that they had no openings, and that I wasn't the only one with hearing loss and I needed to wait my turn. I called the hospital in my hometown (which about 250 miles from me), and they told me they had no openings until April, but would try contact people in ENT who were at lunch, and told me they would get back to me. That didn't happen. I called everywhere I could find in my state that has ENTs, but I still couldn't find anywhere that accepts new adult patients that had an opening before March 26th. 

Given that my ear problems have gone nowhere but downhill, I'm terrified that I'm going to completely lose hearing in one or both ears **(and my fears have been realized)**. I know my ER won't help, and I don't know what else I can do without them. I have no idea where to go or what to do. Could someone please give me advice? Where can I go that might actually have a chance of getting my hearing back before it's too late? Do most ERs not have any way of treating things like this? Going deaf is one of my greatest fears and I've been suicidal ever since the ER told me was out of luck. I just want my ear problems to stop.

**TL;DR ""ear infection"" has been going on for 2 months, resisted treatment, and caused me to go deaf in one ear. ER told me they can't help and the soonest I can see a specialist is in a month. What can I do to get this seen before the deafness becomes permanent?**",487,125,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/fbmmax/ive_gone_completely_deaf_in_one_ear_and_the_er/

Reading your post, my concern is sudden sensorineural hearing loss. In that regard, I am only concerned about the change in hearing to the right ear. There is a likelihood that you have some degree of Eustachian tube dysfunction as sudden hearing loss would not account for the other symptoms previously, particularly the pain. 

You are also correct that it is essentially an ENT emergency that is often treated with high dose steroids within the first 2 weeks of symptom onset. You need an audiogram and evaluation by an ENT. Yes, I read the post and it sounds like for whatever reason you've been getting the runaround. I don't know how to help you there. You can try another emergency department, that may work; or explain to the receptionist that you have sudden hearing loss (which I am sure you have).",300,0,

Lost complete mobility in her left arm 15 mins after a flu shot.,HelpMyMum4757,Layperson/not verified as healthcare professional.,1605786791.0,"37F | 5'8 |Overweight |White British | Loss Mobility In arm |15 days |Broken Back? , Deep Vein Thrombosis, Gluten Intolerant |Unknown Medication| No smoking |Social Drinker | No rec Drugs | UK

Hi all, I am looking for any insightful information to help my mum in her current condition.

Quick Overview : We live on the UK, my mum works within the hospital, she was a radiographer. Now she gives people heart attacks. Bit strange. But its for nuclear medicine.....soooo yeah. She is 37, quite healthy. But takes a type of steroid medication and, what she calls ""horse tranquilizers"" for pain to help with a spinal injury (I don't really Know, I think a broken back. She can still walk though ) and is gluten intolerant and has deep vein thrombosis. Don't know if any of that helps but....yeah. If you couldn't tell from the title she has lost the complete use of her left arm 15 minutes after a flu shot. It has since been 15 days.

She went into the hospital to get a flu vaccination, within 15 minutes of this she lost complete use of her left arm. This began slowly. A tingling sensation that began to spread through her arm beginning to feel limp and weak, unable to even remove the blood pressure cuplet...? thingy. idk really know. I do believe all feeling has gone as well.

They used a short needle, so it shouldn't be nerve damage they said.

Once this happened she spent the next 2 days in the hospital as they tried to figure out what the problem was. They released her without figuring out what the issue is, they're still communicating with different specialists but no one knows.

She has since been able to EVER, ever so slightly able to move the tips of her thumb and index finger. she does not know which one she is moving however.

They suggested that it could be  **Brachial neuritis** and it could take a month for this to sort itself out. They also suggested many other possibilities that aren't as hopeful.

I hope madness made sense to anyone. I hope one of you can give me something helpful that I could rely to my mum and her doctors, without looking like some nut with web md.

Would like an instant fix or name like in films, but I understand the situation. Even simple things like stretches' and exercises that might help would be wonderful.

If you did read all of this, Thank you. I just want my mum to get better and I'm happy someone else out there cares enough to at least read.

Thank you again all.

&#x200B;

EDIT - Hi again, I would like to thank you all for your responses and the feedback you have given. We are still waiting to get further tests and appointments made, but have spoken to the doctors regarding the help received here. Sorry for the wait.

I did however miss out and inaccurately stated some information which I will correct now.

Originally I said it took 15 mins for complete weakness, this was in fact 30.

Her hand was locked in a fixed position unless manually moved with her other hand, and it would keep going cold.

Regarding the vaccine, it has been reported locally. It is still in discussion if it should be reported to the flu vaccine company  (Doctors Choice) or if its a human error. The same batch number is being used in the hospital and no one else has had the side effect. Out of her box 8 others had the vaccine before my mum and not one has had any side effect. 

The injection site as asked for, is nothing its just her aim. Its 5 weeks old and seemingly normal. My mum doesn't really wanna post any photos also.

On a positive note she is able to move her wrist now, (Not sure quite how she can move it. She hasn't got back to me yet) 

Negative note, little finer and ring hardly move and is extremely painful. All fingers and hand is swollen and cold to the touch.",480,115,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/jx1d31/37f_please_help_my_mum_lost_complete_mobility_in/

Sex: Female

Height: 24.61 inches

Weight: 13.49 pounds

Diagnosed medical: NAS

Medications: None

I have had custody of my niece for the last 8 months and she is nearly 9 months old. She spent the first month of her life in the NICU because she was born with NAS; having been exposed to methamphetamine, cocaine, and heroine. From the very beginning of me having her she has very sensitive skin, she bruises far easier than my children ever had. Example: she laid her head on my mother's wrist for about ten minutes and her bracelet caused a notable bruise on her face.

As far as developmentally, my niece is advanced and hitting milestones early. She is already pulling up, babbling and saying words, etc. She is a very active baby, and her bruising has continued along with her added mobility. i have tried to baby-proof my home to the best of my ability, but I suppose I have failed miserably because her bruising still happened. I have also discussed the bruising and finding a cause t every well-child visit and every additional visit we get related to her NAS, as well.

Last Monday I woke up to find her leg twisted in her crib and she did not cry until she actually saw me. I cannot tell you exactly how it was positioned because it was a different type of cry and i panicked in trying to free her. Her leg was caught between the bumper (i know it's not supposed to be in there, but if it isn't she will continuously bang her head on the wood when she is upset at bedtime) and her leg was in between the slats of the crib. I was able to twist her leg free after maneuvering her leg a bit. It was red and she was obviously upset, but no swelling had appeared as of yet. I comforted her and got her to calm down and we headed downstairs, so I could make a bottle and breakfast.

I placed my niece in her walker, that she does not usually walk in, she just kind of bounces. I made her a bottle, put a handful of cheerios on her walker tray, and then started breakfast for myself and my four year old. She was no longer upset and I continued our usual daily routine, as I had previous times she got her leg stuck in the crib. Throughout the day I did notice that her leg that got caught was kind of causing her issues; she didn't jump on it as much, she did not use it as much during crawling, she was not trying to stand, etc. Around dinnertime I began to notice that her leg was starting to swell. I became concerned at that time, but my boyfriend was not home, so i could not immediately go to the emergency room due to covid-19 and I did not want the possibility of exposing my daughter by taking her too.

When my boyfriend got home from work, which was around ten that night. When we got to the ER they performed x-rays on her leg and they said that they could not see a fracture, but decided to splint. They would need radiology too review because she did move (she hates being held down) and they were not as clear as they would like. We were sent on our way with the splint and advised to follow up with her PCP. The next morning, I called first thing to her PCP, and had to schedule an appointment for the next day. We went to the PCP and she wasn't alarmed by the results at that time either and said we needed to follow up with an Ortho in about a week.

I missed a call from her PCP early evening that said the radiologist was able to review her x-rays and there might be some concern and that I needed to take her into Children's ER and they would retake the x-rays. So, I got her and myself ready and packed up the car to go, with my boyfriend and four year old staying home again. Just as I put on my seat belt a lady with a binder knocks at my door and my four year old opened the door. I freaked out, and hopped out of the car. Turns out she was with Child Protective Services, and interviewed us and went to the ER with my niece and myself.

The PCP had called the ER ahead to tell them I would be coming in for additional x-rays, but in looking at my niece's paperwork her admission reason was listed was ""Non-Accidental Trauma"" and this was prior to them obtaining a clear x-ray of the original issue. So, first I would like to know if this is common, to list this as a reason to admit someone into the ER without even having all of the information. I feel like it created a biased among the nurses and doctors who reviewed her papers and examined her. She was admitted for testing and observation and i was treated very poorly by staff, from being ignored, to a nurse huffing and rolling her eyes at me.

During her ER visit I was presented with her leg's x-ray and i was advised it was called a metaphyseal fracture to her growth plate, I remember this specifically because I asked the doctor to spell it and explain it. My concern was her growth and I wanted to have a full understanding of what was wrong with her. The doctor said that these types of fractures are also called bucket-handle fractures and briefly explained why. They then performed additional testing on my niece; a skeletal survey, a brain CT, and some blood work. They did find an additional fracture in her right ulna, which i was told was her wrist area. And they later found a hairline fracture on her back left side of her skull, but no injuries to her brain.

After being in the ER for close to four hours, I was told that DHS was taking custody of both my niece and my four year old and I was required too stay with my niece while she was in the hospital for observation. She was supposed to have additional testing done during her observation period to try to find an underlying explanation to her issues. I was only visited for additional blood testing. She was visited by a CSI photographer and a forensic pediatrician in addition to the regular team of doctor's and nurses.

What I need help with is in understanding her discharge paperwork, it says something completely different as far as her leg injury from what I was able to google. I feel as though I am in an uphill battle to get my babies back and I am terrified that they are giving me conflicting information all along the way and from this doctor to that doctor or nurse, information changes. I cannot afford an expert to get a second opinion from, so I am hoping you guys can help to point me in the right direction.

Below is taken from her Skeletal Survey:

-healing fracture of the distal right ulnar diaphysis with osseous callus formation and fracture line still evident

-small linear calcific density lateral to the distal left tibial epiphysis and mild widening of the distal tibial physis suspicious for an acute fracture. No dislocation. Left ankle soft tissue swelling is present.

There's a reason for this, and it will be frustrating to hear, but you deserve to hear it. This is an extremely complicated case - medically, emotionally, and legally. The child has clear red flags for non-accidental trauma (abuse). These need to be investigated thoroughly, and the system, in an abundance of caution, has removed the children from OP's care until it can be determined that they are safe. The child already has a forensic pediatrician involved. You can be assured that the workup will investigate any clotting and bone disorders that could possibly explain the injuries ... bearing in mind that children with those disorders can also be abused.

Reddit does not absolve doctors of liability. We provide advice and off-the-cuff second opinions here in our free time to help point people in the right direction. Not so much to provide answers, but to help people ask the right questions. We do this without a full understanding or documentation of the case. In this particular case, doing so would provide a disservice to the patient, to OP, and the physician responding to the particulars. It is potentially dangerous, in a variety of ways, to all of those parties. And it could very well embroil a physician legally in the case.

Seeing those two pieces of clinical information are red flags for child abuse.

You do sound like you love your niece and children and I don't want you to feel like anybody is against you. The measures the hospital and staff have taken is to make sure your niece/children are safe. Is there anybody else at home who watches the children when you are not there or someone who has access to the child when you are not around? The child might have been abused without your knowledge.

**Update**:  Since about 4 this afternoon I've been talking with her.  Unsurprisingly, she is seems mostly unfazed by my concern, and even the mention of her grandchildren seeing her die didn't seem to have much of an effect.  She's very adamant that she's done enough research to know that this is safe, and claims that she's paying careful attention to her body and knows when to stop.  Also claims to have been dry fasting for a couple days at a time for years.  She says if she has any kidney pain, she'll stop.  If she passes out, she'll stop.  If she stops urinating, she'll stop.  I argued that by that point it would be too far gone, but that was ignored.  The next step is that I go over to their place tomorrow and talk with her face to face.  This is risky for me because I'm in the middle of packing to move next week for a new job, and my sis, bro in law and their kids all have some kind of really terrible stomach flu.  So that will put me at risk, and by extension my pregnant wife.

So tomorrow morning I will go over and see what's what, and sort it out the easy way or the hard way.  I spoke with a friend of a friend who is a medical doctor, he agreed with everything I said and also agreed with the opinions here of having her committed if absolutely necessary.  I'll do it if I have to.  I don't hesitate because of a stigma regarding mental health, but because I don't want to take away her autonomy.  And...I fear it will damage our relationship irreparably, and send her spiraling back into a depression.  But like I said, I'll make the call if I have to.

Thank you all for your suggestions and research, I appreciate them.  I'll update again tomorrow when there's more to tell.

&#x200B;

**Update 2 (7/6)**:  Meeting didn't happen today, the flu seems gone but my sister was sanitizing her house.  I understand that many of you thought it was more important that I go there, but this was a very nasty flue that nearly sent all of them to the hospital.  I cannot risk my wife falling that kind of will with a bun in the oven.  We're 35 so already high-risk and my wife's mother had a history of miscarriages.  I couldn't risk it, I hope you understand.

With the all-clear from my sister, I'm planning to go tomorrow.  They have been keeping a very watchful eye on her.  But I got some more info from my sister and bro-in-law.  Apparently she's not just drinking a shot of espresso every so often like she told me, but a full, large cup of normal coffee with some herbal product mixed in.  While it's obviously still not a good idea it explains why she isn't dead, since it's mostly water.  She's also been doing next to nothing for the past 5 days, just cooped up in her room.  She got pissed at my sister and told her not to talk to me about these things any more, since I 'get worried'.  Sister didn't listen obviously.  So in addition to a resolution about this fasting issue, we also will be having a conversation about trust.

I do appreciate all of the advise and seemingly genuine concern.  This doesn't seem to me to be as much of an emergency as most of you believe, based on the information I have.  I will have a better idea when I see her tomorrow.

&#x200B;

**Update 3 (7/7):**  I just got home from visiting.  It was probably the hardest thing I've had to do in my life.  I started off by taking stock of her physical state as much as I could.  Through hearing her talk she was very obviously parched, you could hear it in her speech.  I asked about it and she didn't deny it.  She was steady on her feet, but walking very slowly, and carefully; physically weak is my guess.  Other than that, she seemed normal.  There was no confusion that I could detect, and she seemed to be coherent and responsive.

Next I wanted to take a closer look at her regiment.  I had received some incorrect information from my sister.  She had been taking a 2 oz. espresso shot twice a day, four hours apart.  She was mixing it with some herbal powders she was getting from her fasting website, and it looked like they were just combinations of everyday spices.  It didn't seem to me that they'd do any harm.  What I really wanted to know was what her daily water intake was and I found out.

After that, we mostly re-hashed a lot of the conversation we had via text.  I told her that I'd spoke to an actual medical doctor, and that although he was amazed and impressed with her tenacity, he thought the practice was highly dangerous with little to no benefit in her chosen form.  I mentioned to her that if she did happen to need a kidney, that were unlikely to give her one if it was known she was irresponsible with them in the past.  I mentioned passing out and falling onto the stairs.  Nothing fazed her.  She said it didn't matter what I said, it was her choice.  It was clear to me at that point that she would see no reason, so I went with my only remaining option.  I told her that almost everyone I spoke to believed this was a medical emergency and I should be calling 911.  She said she wouldn't go.  I told her that if the paramedics arrive and know that she's been dehydrating herself, they could see it as self harm and then it really wouldn't be up to her.  There was a very long period of silence, but after a little colorful language she got herself a glass of water, and took a sip (she correctly said that she has to drink it slowly). She said she's never been more angry at us in her entire life.

So, maybe that's the end of it, but I fear not.  I'm moving across the state next week and I won't be able to check on her physically, I'll have to rely on my brother in law and sister for that.

This is a life-threatening emergency.

As well as the risks inherent in severe dehydration - which can easily be fatal after even 72 hours - depending on any other conditions, your mother is now potentially at risk for a condition called 'Refeeding Syndrome' where a starved body reacts badly to the reintroduction of nutrition, sometimes with lethal consequences.  

You won't find a ton of literature around this to persuade her with, because it's just so insane and obviously bad for health that it is completely unethical to create these conditions experimentally.  (Much of the knowledge about it comes from survivors of concentration camps in the holocaust.)

Your mother needs to know two things: 

1) Her current actions may well kill her, or lead to irreversible damage, including brain damage. 

2) She isn't actually losing much weight.  The 2lbs/day is mostly water that is vital to life.

You can get an idea of just how much risk of refeeding syndrome your mother is at from the below.  At 5 days this all starts to get very serious, and actually may be best managed as an inpatient.

&#x200B;

Depending on where  you live, you may also need to consider having your mother involuntarily committed on mental health grounds.  She seems to be a danger to herself - and unable to understand the risks - so may meet the criteria.

Let’s compare.,vanyali,Layperson/not verified as healthcare professional.,1584894623.0,"I and my family are having very mild symptoms after a trip to New York City that makes we wonder if we might  be in the category of “asymptotic” COVID cases.  I thought it would be interesting to hear from other people and we could try comparing to see if we could try to learn something about how this might look at different levels of severity.  

Here are our symptoms:  

Dad:  runny nose, sore throat, cough bad enough to wake from sleep.  Didn’t seem to have a fever, though the whole city seemed to run out of thermometers simultaneously so a little hard to prove.

Mom:  stomach pain, diarrhea (1-2 days), headaches (1-2 days), muscle pain (ongoing, about a week so far), uncharacteristic acne/mild skin rash on face.

Teen daughter:   Headaches, muscle aches, chills, tiredness, but doesn’t seem to have fever. Feels asthmatic but doesn’t really have a cough (she has mild asthma).  Same uncharacteristic acne/mild face rashes.

So what do you think?  Any of you having mild symptoms that you are wondering about?  Let’s compare our experiences and see if we can figure anything out about mild/borderline asymptomatic infections!

Demographic info so post doesn’t get removed again:

Dad:  45 year old male.  White.  BMI 25.  Celiac disease, environmental allergies.  Non-smoker, non-drinker.

Mom:  44 year old female.  White.  BMI 26.  Some loosely-diagnosed autoimmune disease that doesn’t cause much trouble.  Non-smoker, non-drinker.

Daughter:  18 year old female.  White.  Good BMI.  Mild asthma, some environmental allergies.

Edit:  thought it would be interesting to add that all 3 of us have had our flu shots this year.  

My 14 year old daughter has not had her flu shot (couldn’t get the egg-free jab for her).  She is showing no symptoms beyond maybe a slight cough in NY about a week ago while Dad was coughing.

EDIT:  Starting on week 3 now and Mom is starting to get a slight cough, breathing getting slightly difficult and pulse much higher (usual for me is in the 60’s but now I’m around 80 laying in bed, 120 standing up or up to 140’s after 1 flight of stairs).

When I was thinking about going to medical school, I knew that I was 10+ years behind most people who become doctors. 

I talked with friends and family. I had to finish my undergraduate degree, apply to and get accepted to medical school, spend 4 years in medical school, then 3-10 years in postgraduate training, and take on 100's of thousands of dollars in debt.

Did I really want to spend all that time and money? Did it make sense?

 From most people, the advice (which varied from ""go for it!"" to ""are you fucking crazy?!"") was difficult to interpret. Mostly, it seemed that the advice was about the ADVICE GIVER, and not objective, let alone tailored to me.

Then I talked to my grandmother. She said: ""well, the years are going to go by either way.""

So that is my advice to you: the years are going to go by either way. You can either try to improve your life and health, or not. Improving your health will certainly not be wasted, regardless of whether there is damage done.

Embarrassing issue involving male ejaculation.,heat_feat,Layperson/not verified as healthcare professional,1625367300.0,"Long story short I can't masturbate due to crippling pain when I ejaculate. I first ejaculated when I was 12 and I spent 30 minutes laying on the bathroom floor crying. It was a sharp and burning pain that lingered a few minutes after the release. My stomach then hurt and I felt like throwing up.

I'm 23 now and I have never purposely ejaculated since. Every time I have a wet dream or whatever it's called I'm woken up from the pain. I've been to the urologist 2 times but only recently becuase it's an embarrassing issue. They couldn't tell me what was wrong expect for inflammation in my pancreas which is supposedly temporary. I don't see that lasting all these years. 

The problem now is a little more complicated. This is the embarrassing part: So for the past year I have been ""edging"". I bring myself close to ejaculation and I stop immediately. I do this becuase of small amount of pleasure I get from doing it. There have been times where I've accidentally gone too far and I've actually ejaculated. It hurt. Bad. Lately I have been doing it a lot less close to release so I don't have to worry about it. 4 nights ago for whatever reason I was a lot more sensitive than usual so I accidentally went to the point where I felt it was about to release. I stopped myself but this feeling that it is about to come out lasted an hour. I was in hell and crying because I was so scared. It went away and I was relieved. It came back but it came in waves. I eventually fell asleep on my back too afraid to move. 

I woke up and it was gone but that night it came back. It's been coming in waves ever since and tonight is the worst yet. I've urinated many times since then and I looked up blue balls and people say it goes away and ""resets"" after a few hours. This isn't blue balls obviously. I don't know what the hell it is. It gets more intense when I move my legs a certain way while sitting down. I know this is a problem for a urologist but can anyone tell me what this might be? I'm in agonizing mental pain right now because I've spent the past 4 days knowing that at any second the worst pain I've ever felt can come out of nowhere.",472,66,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/odbupk/please_help_me_embarrassing_issue_involving_male/

360,Post,k5tgaq,"My Arms Are Turning Blue, Please Help",Bethany_09,Layperson/not verified as healthcare professional.,1606984096.0,"Edit 2 Revised:

TL;DR: I removed lab values, as they are no longer the most recent. I have normal skin underneath, to my knowledge, my skin just sheds blue - unaware as to why. I have neurologic and gastric issues, like already stated in “edit one,” so no need to retouch on that, just briefed about a new procedure I didn’t know was going to be requested. I will update about the (dead) blue skin, the literal reason for the post in the first place, if ever discovered. 

-

No confirmed, or believed hematologic issues. I only shed blue skin? My skin recently came off, and it’s pink underneath like it used to be, for some reason it just comes off in blue heaps (random dead skin, I assume, but unsure as to why the color is blue). The veins are extremely bright, but that’s about it underneath, I believe. I already have eczema/atopic dermatitis, I know that, but this still confuses me because it doesn’t appear to be that. I plan on seeing my derm soon just in case. 

I thought I’d add this information, only to discuss how thorough I’ve tried to be, but none of which is the cause for it either. I have a whole host of neurological issues, migraines and OC as listed below, among other newly diagnosed issues, like tremors and possible nocturnal seizures (I’m epileptic). I’m going to be getting a VEEG done, as ordered by the newly epileptologist I just began seeing. My medications are being readjusted, and a hospital is the only safe way to do so. 

I also have gastric issues, like I said below. 

Bottom line, thank you all. If I ever figure out why I’m shedding blue skin, I’ll make sure to share. 

••••••••••

TL;DR: I took all suggestions as best I could. I was denied by hematology, rheumatology found no issue despite only slightly abnormal values (mainly NOT severe muscular degeneration that I’ve now been made aware of, it didn’t alarm him like I said), EKG and EEG requested are both normal. There have been newly diagnosed neurologic issues, but easily fixed with botox. 

-

Edit: Thank you to everyone who suggested various things that it could possibly be, and please know that I took your advice, both from this post, and the follow-up one I made awhile back, that I’ve since deleted. Here is the in-depth follow-up that some had asked me to provide. 

Hematology: I was denied by two different hospitals, even though I had a thorough PCP referral, as both places said my issues weren’t possibly blood related. There were no other hematologic options in my area, so I decided I needed to move on from hematology completely, because I wasn’t getting anywhere. I’ve not been tested for any hemoglobinopathy as suggested on this post, or any other blood-related issue due to this. 

Rheumatology: This was the major one recommended on my other post, and I actually just went there a couple days ago after a successful (and surprisingly quick) referral. Despite my leg pain, color-changes and other various issues discussed below, the doctor doesn’t believe it’s anything rheumatology related, either. A physician on the other post I had made, suggested getting a work-up and asking about APS (antiphospholipid syndrome), but I was only tested for possible muscle diseases to my knowledge. I haven’t received those results yet, but I’m sure they’ll be normal. We’ll see. 

I’ve also recently had a redo of my heart echocardiogram done (which came out normal) because the last one was poorly imaged. My most recent (required) EEG was completely normal, but I’ve been put on yet another epilepsy medication, unfortunately. 

The only thing I’ve been diagnosed with, since when this was originally posted, has been migraines and occipital neuralgia, which I now receive injections for.

Original Post:

25F, 185lbs, white, non-smoker, non-drinker. 

TL;DR: major breathing difficulty, chest discomfort/pressure, (mainly) left leg heaviness/throbbing, odd blood consistency and possibly abnormal values. 

-

Hello, I’m in quite a predicament. I’ve now been labeled a “zebra” by a vein specialist, because no one can figure out the reasoning behind my current issues.

For context, this is now seems to be a somewhat progressive issue, as different symptoms have arisen as time has gone on. I began not being able to breathe well sometime last year, but every time medical professionals take my O2 stats, it never goes below 98. However, it’s becoming increasingly harder within these last few months, especially taking deep breaths. After having some bad reflux episodes, I was told I had GERD, and then given some medication. However, I’ve now been hospitalized twice for my severe breathing issues, both occasions in September, after my GERD diagnosis (and it’s well controlled/no reflux episodes), so I have a feeling it’s definitely a separate issue. My chest also feels as if there’s a crushing force on it very frequently.  

I started getting severe leg pain, that made my (especially my left) calves feel heavy one minute, almost like carrying around tree trunks, and then pulsing/throbbing the next. I was scanned for blood clots in my left leg while at the ER, and everything came back normal. The same day I was scanned, a nurse noticed my left arm being a vibrant blue. The ER doctor then pointed out the fact he’d noticed that it was also on my right arm at that point, as well. Ultrasounds have recently been done on both my arms, but those results also came back normal. 

My blood is now starting to be impacted as well I believe, as it’s appearing to have trouble stopping or clotting quickly. I’m not sure if this issue is related to the color-changing or not. My blood will borderline gush out after blood draws/IV site wounds. My RBC has also been consistently high for awhile now, and my MCH and MCV are now dropping again. The values being abnormal aren’t by much or extremely significant, but I’m not sure the reason for the abnormality either (again, reiterating the fact that I’m not sure if it’s connected to the color-changing or not).

EDIT: I saw the conversation further below. Some common traits for hemoglobinopathies are indeed low hemoglobin, high RBC and low MCV. I'd say you could catch about 80% based on these values (but then, electrophoresis is still required for final diagnosis, or DNA testing for alpha thalassemias). Anemias can be compensated for with high RBC counts. MCV, as in sickle cell anemia, may be normal since the sickeling occurs in the microcirculation at low PO2s.

Edit 2: One emergency room trip later and we have a tentative answer that is good, but rather anticlimactic. The doctor(?) He saw did a very quick ear exam and saw the likely cause: acne. My dad is old but is still prone to acne and it appears he has a particularly nasty zit in his ear partially blocking the canal, the drainage while having blood was most likely a mixture of all the fun stuff that goes on between an ear and acne... now I am personally questioning whether my father actually went to the doctor or if he knew it was acne and just didnt want to admit it, or the worst answer would be he's making assumptions and lying. As for the vomiting, GERD is the culprit- I did make sure he made an appointment with out primary because his gag reflux has gotten weirdly stronger and sometimes coughing will make him vomit which is new.

My husbands official diagnosis is Metastatic renal cell carcinoma, which spread to his lungs. They went in and took the tumor off the kidney (he has horseshoe kidney so he only technically has one) and he was very optimistic about getting it all from that area. Said his body encapsulated the tumor and they didn’t see anything else on his kidney. They said there were “nodes” in his lungs, but that they weren’t treating and just want to keep an eye on until mid December, then talk about what to do if they grow. The problem is, he is weak and is having trouble breathing. 

No chemo, no radiation, no immunotherapy yet or maybe at all. Is this normal?

His lymph nodes have been so swollen I can see them under his collar bone, and in his neck. I’m worried. Is metastatic a automatic stage 4 diagnosis? 

Is his prognosis good? His oncologist and doctor seem to think so, but they won’t really speak on anything early on. They said we would meet in December and talk more then. What do I do now? 

My husband isn’t able to work, and is taking time off from getting his degree. He can barely walk around without being winded. I have picked up extra shifts at work, so I don’t get to see him and how he’s doing. I just want to know if I should trust what they are telling us, or ask for them to check him again since he’s so weak. Help? I’m losing my mind.

So he should definitely be in some type of therapy if he has metastatic renal cell cancer. Typically this is immunotherapy which is typically not too hard on the body (this is significantly easier than something like chemo). There are many medications out there that all have pretty good effects on cancer. It sounds like your husband had a “cytoreductive nephrectomy"" where the kidney is taken out even though we know the cancer is spread. The goal is to just get as much cancer out as possible. Typically if there is remaining cancer (in the lungs for example) we then give immunotherapy however you do need to wait about 6 weeks after surgery for recovery. I'm not sure where he is on his recovery from surgery. Bottom line, I would talk to your oncologist about starting treatment, especially immunotherapy.

Yes stage 4 = metastatic cancer. This is true of essentially all cancers. 

i will be blunt his prognosis is not good. With appropriate treatment his chance of living another 5 years is probably ~20%. This doesn't mean he'll die tomorrow but his time is limited

More worrying is how young he is - 41 is incredibly young. You mentioned he is a veteran - he should see someone asap at the VA. If he had any exposure during combat he may be able to have all his medical bills covered. This is incredibly long and  bureaucratic process but would be something I'd strongly suggest looking into.

My baby has been in the hospital for a week and they just keep finding more stuff wrong with him. Pretty sure I just had a nervous breakdown because there is no solution or plan and I just want to figure out what’s wrong. 

TL;DR: heart murmur, pulmonary hypertension, PDA, ASD, kidney dilation, dysphagia/ aspirating every gulp. Also inguinal hernia, two vessel cord, polyhydraminos, ear pits (mundane and probably unrelated)

I am 26F and during the pregnancy we found a 2 vessel cord, left kidney and ureter dilation at 36 week growth scan, and polyhydraminos. He was induced at 39 weeks, was 7 lbs 5 oz at birth. He never was able to latch and showed disinterest in the breast. He seemed to do well on the bottle. His kidneys looked normal at 1 month old. 

My list of concerns grew by his 2 month appointment. Developmental delay (not smiling yet), low weight, “scream-coughing” after feeds, always sounded congested. I was dismissed but one day long story short he wasn’t eating and had a bulge in his groin and we went to the Er, discovered he had an inguinal hernia, it popped back in and he ate and we scheduled surgery for another day. 

At his 2 month appointment he was only 8 lbs 13 oz, <1 percentile. Big concern before surgery. I upped his formula for 22 cals and he was all smiles and eye contact so I was really sure he was improving. He was watched over a week and only gained 2 oz. Then they found a heart murmur. 

We were sent to childrens hospital. ECG revealed small ASDs, a large PDA with bilateral flow, and pulmonary hypertension. Normal heart structure. A CT scan showed normal lungs but they are uniformly hazy. Kidneys are dilated again, this time both of them instead of just the left. They also noticed he had an undecended testicle but it seems to go up and down. Worst of all, they did a swallow study and found he is aspirating with every single gulp. His tongue, uvula, and throat muscles don’t seem to be doing the right job. He is also sucking poorly which explains breastfeeding failing. They don’t know if it’s a genetic or neurological thing. 


That puts the list of problems at
- pulmonary hypertension
- large PDA
- small ASDs
- heart murmur 
- kidney and ureter dilation
- dysphagia / aspiration
- inguinal hernia

I was feeling hopeful when we only knew about the heart issues because there was a plan. He responds immediately to oxygen so they are putting him on sildenafil. His heart is already doing much better on that and a diuretic. But when we learned about the feeding and aspiration problems I just broke. They don’t have answers. it’s going to take 4-6 weeks for the genetic testing to come back. 

I am very certain this is a genetic thing, based on how many things are wrong. I know this is above reddit’s pay grade but if anyone has an inkling of a suspicion of what this could be I want to know. Please look at pictures of my baby as well. He looks a little strange but nothing that stands out. He just doesn’t look like me or my husband very obviously, has a broad nasal bridge, ear pits, and distinctive eyes. 

Any help would be appreciated. This is the worst week of my life.

I'm so sorry.  Obviously, I'm going by what you have listed here, but I don't know all the subtle details of his particular case, so this is somewhat generalized - Be sure to confirm everything with the people taking care of your baby.

First off, is he in the NICU or PICU - that affects how they think about the constellation a little bit sometimes - so if he's in the PICU, the things I worry about might have already been ruled out or they weren't considered because they don't think of new diagnosis congenital always.

I'll talk about some of the findings to start with: The pulmonary hypertension (PHTN) is most likely secondary to the large PDA that has been shunting extra blood to his lungs for his entire life most likely.  That puts extra fluid and flow in his lungs, which causes PHTN to develop because of the lungs trying to compensate for all these things happening.

*Most likely* the PHTN is reversible. If it is secondary to his heart (kinda) defect, and/or the aspiration of fluids, once you address those, the PHTN will reverse, because the conditions that caused it in the first place are better!

There is a chance that it is a primary PHTN, which would have been a congenital malformation in the lungs/vascular system around the lungs.  But with the ECHO findings and the overall mildness of it, I would place money that it is a secondary hypertension.

Have you only had a swallow study?  I would see if they considered an H-type tracheoesophageal fistula, which can be difficult to diagnose and is found in these symptom constellations and a swallow study alone would not be able to see it necessarily - he would need a contrast esophogram.

Has he been seen by Ophthalmology? In his pictures, it's difficult to tell, but his R eye might have a very minor defect called a coloboma. You can also have no visible colobomas and it only be visible in an exam on the optic nerve.

I'm not sure what's going on with the kidneys. I lean towards a reflux because of the variable dilation, but that's just a lean.

When you have a lot of things happening in one baby, of course they consider genetic syndromes. And his genes may show something, but they may not. Kids with VACTERL (a constellation of symptoms often seen together) do not have any genetic differences that we've been able to find.  And sometimes we simply haven't discovered the syndrome yet.

But in the end, with the exception of being able to anticipate issues somewhat (which has benefits and drawbacks itself) all the genetic tests won't tell you how to treat the symptoms and issues an individual child automatically.  Syndrome or not, we still have to support the baby in everything it needs to do.

They also might potentially do something called a ""skeletal survey"", to see if there are minor malformations in bones that might have not been apparent, because sometimes it goes along with these sorts of syndromes.

Most likely they will do an MRI of his head to look for any abnormalities in his brain. Often there are none, it's just part of the whole workup for genetic issues.

I am concerned about it being something genetic as, based on his findings and his physical appearance that I can see from the pictures: his ears are potentially low-set (harder to tell because of the angle), his nasal bridge is a little flatter and wider than we would expect in a baby his age (babies really do look similar!), the pre-auricular (ear) pits, and I would really like to feel his sutures.

Again, the only treatment for many genetic syndromes is supportive. So, if there's a fistula, close it. Treat the lung and heart issues. Give him all the physical/occupational therapy you would for any baby having those issues, for whatever reason.

If there's not a fistula and it is that he is truly aspirating everything he eats, they will have to talk about putting in a feeding tube, so he can eat safely until his development is able to handle it. If it is so bad that he is even aspirating his own spit, that's much more concerning. There are some interventions you can do to try and minimize that, but if it continues to be an issue, you would have to talk about protecting his airway with a tracheostomy.  I don't think that is likely at all, but when we have to think about serious aspiration, it has to at least be considered.

The PDA can be attempted to be fixed in two ways, with medication and surgery. While the surgery sounds scarier, I would lean towards that in his case, because of his age and that there is PHTN.  The surgery can be done either in the cath lab or OR (even at the patient bedside in the NICU).  In the OR procedure, it's not open heart.  It's a small cut on the side of his chest.  Both of them use something to clamp off the flow of the PDA. The medication can use several potential medications to try to convince the PDA to close itself, but IMO, the risks outweigh the benefits at this age. Just ask about the risks and benefits if they want to do medication. (and obviously with surgery too LOL)

The kidneys will really depend on what the final diagnosis is.  Sometimes surgery is needed, sometimes not. Sometimes prophylactic antibiotics are needed, sometimes not.  Hard to tell.

The sildenafil, diuretic and oxygen will likely come off once his PHTN resolves.

Has genetics actually come to see him, they are great at knowing how all the syndromes ""look"".  He doesn't fit a typical CHARGE or VACTERL picture (two of the more common ones we see)

He used to consume cocaine for a few months around 4 years ago. Went through rehab, turned his life around. Half a year ago, he turned to alcohol, but (AFAIK) this happened only a few times until he decided to quit drinking higher-percentage beverages and drastically cut other drinks like beer. This morning, we found him with a pulse of around 180, pupils dialated to different sizes and drenched in sweat. There was an empty bottle of beer in the room, no other obvious substance. Right before EMT arrived, his heart stopped beating so we initiated CPR right away.  Muscle tone was high. Paramedics took over, they even had a machine to assist, yet after 30 min of this they decided to take him to the hospital (his temp was still 39° C or 102F), where he was pronounced dead shortly after.

A doctor in my family can't think of a substance which would cause the symptoms and be treatable with an antidote (like opioids), so that must have been why they didn't administer anything other than adrenaline (to my knowledge).

So we are left wondering if this could be some overdose. Nothing else seems to make sense to us:

\- natural causes seem unlikely because natural heart failure wouldn't have caused heart rate to spike and keep tonus high- maybe cocaine and flushed the bag (didn't find one) or some pill-shaped substance?

390,Post,fl7ypn,Can coronavirus present as a cough and shortness of breath without other severe symptoms?,Unknown,,1584614414.0,"I know you guys get a stupid amount of these posts, but I'm trying to figure out if I should go to a doctor to get tested, and I figured you guys might be able to tell me if my mild symptoms have any chance of being caused by the coronavirus.

Me: female, age 20 (21 in a few days), 5'10"", 160 lbs., no comorbidities, mentally and physically healthy and fit, no drugs/alcohol, no medications.  Possibly came into contact with someone sick. 

A few of my distant coworkers have tested positive for coronavirus.  Two days ago, someone I share a desk with (who works the opposite night shift as me) went home sick with severe symptoms - it really sounds like he has the disease. 

Now, four days ago, before hearing about these cases, I had a headache, some body aches, a very mild sore throat.  I'd explain it as, like, the most mild cold you can have.  I popped an ibuprofen and went to work.  

For the next two days, I continued to have the same very mild symptoms.  No fever, no runny nose.  I thought it was allergies.  But I started developing a cough.  At first, it felt like when you exercise too much and can't breathe properly, but with a little chest pain to boot.  But these symptoms have gotten progressively worse, to the point where I can't take a deep breath without coughing.  My chest burns like someone rubbed some mild capsaicin cream on the inside of my lungs.  My heart rate is higher than normal, and I have some mild body aches/fatigue.  When I move around, I get short of breath way too fast.  Additionally, today I think I may have developed the mildest of fevers (though I have no thermometer on hand).  

The feeling in my chest really reminds me of that one time I accidentally mixed bleach and ammonia and breathed in some of the fumes, but a little worse.  It's not comfortable, but it's not bad.  I am NOT coughing nonstop.  I can speak, breathe, and sleep normally.  But I undeniably HAVE a cough, and I'm tired.  However, the other symptoms are so mild that if it wasn't for the cough, I'd think it was allergies/psychosomatic symptoms.

I did call out of work and am keeping myself at home.  I feel HORRIBLE about it because my symptoms are so blasted mild, but it's not worth the chance.  I will go to the doctor and get tested if it doesn't go away, but I just figured I'd ask here beforehand - just in case my symptoms in no way match the coronavirus.  I've read about people's symptoms, and most people talk about severe upper respiratory symptoms, which I do not have.  Everything in me is screaming ""you're being dramatic,"" so I thought I might be able to get an opinion here on whether I am, indeed, just being dramatic. 

Thank you so much for reading through.  I appreciate your time.

Edit: I called and asked for a test.  They don't want me to be tested because my symptoms are pretty mild, so I will just be staying home for a bit (5 days) to see if my symptoms get worse at all.  That's how much ATO I have.  If they go away, back to work.  If not, I'll talk to HR and risk my job rather than other people's lives :( Thanks for the help.

Edit 2: reports of positive tests in my area have been rolling in today, including in my boyfriend's workplace.  Yikes.  

E3: I guess my birthday present is probably going to be unemployment because I'll be doing a full quarantine.

E4: happy news!  I talked to my employer and I won't be fired if I quarantine!  Woot woot!  14 days of bored coughing, here I come.

E5 03/20/2020: yeah it's getting worse.  Chest is on fire.  Hopefully this really isn't the coronavirus, because that would suck.  Stay safe guys.  This shit fucking hurts :)

E6 03/22/2020: bedridden now and they won't test me.  Breathing is hard.  I hate this.

E7: 03/26/2020: finally getting better.  I am still extremely short of breath and can't do much or walk far.  My lungs still ache, and going out in the cold is the worst.  I can't taste or smell very well.  However, I am extremely grateful that the worst of the sickness is through.  That was probably the sickest I've ever been in my life, and it sure wasn't fun.  I'm so glad my employer granted me paid leave; I spent four days in bed and will be self-quarantined for a while yet.  Yeah, this was probably the coronavirus.  Thanks for your help guys

E8: 04/04/2020: I am much recovered.  However, I am still very out of breath.  I ended up calling the covid hotline again (long story involving my now sick roommate) and NOW they want me to get tested - AFTER I HAVE RECOVERED - because I am still very short of breath.

Could be a cyst that's ruptured, but the after effects usually last a bit longer (twisting pain, irritated bowel and bladder etc) and you'd usually only be given pain relief if you go tonhospitsl. May also be an endometriosis deposit that's disturbed (dependent on what your periods are like), or you've just knocked your cervix badly. It may also be irritation of bowel lying next to the vagina. An ovarian torsion would be unlikely.

 As others have said, pain worsening, nausea and vomiting, fever are signs to look out for. Otherwise paracetamol and ibuprofen (and maybe a warm bath) and chill out for the rest of the day.

The doctors “want a chance to figure it out” but it’s been 2 years, my pain is not managed and no one can figure it out.

A few days before quarantine began, I decided to sort of  experiment a bit with my sexuality instead of just being bi curious, and hooked up with a guy on grindr. I was really nervous and we decided to just go slow with him giving me oral. I asked him several times before we got together whether he was STD free and he told me yes multiple times,. I even went as far as to use a condom since I was still very scared. 

Fast forward into full blown quarantine and the guy texted me, saying that he was sorry he lied and that he should have told me the truth. My heart sunk to my stomach when he told me he had HIV and I instantly blocked him before he could say anything else. Now it's been a few months and I've been ridden with anxiety about my health and what will happen to me. I've been looking online about HIV transmission and all the websites said I should be fine but I'm still very scared because apparently you can still get it from oral if the condom breaks(he also sort of licked my balls a bit and idk if that's a risk factor) and all of this was so new to me. Ive basically cried my eyes out and been stuck in a huge depression. I have no one to even talk to because all my friends and family are a bit close minded and this whole situation is just embarrassing.  I can't even go get tested bc all the clinics are busy with the virus patients or are just closed

So I've come here as a sort of last resort because I really dont know what to do. I'm so ashamed of myself for even trying something so stupid and so risky instead of just leaving my curiosity alone.

I Don’t drink or Smoke or take any drugs.

I am desperate for any advice or answers to what’s happening with me; I am sorry for the long read.

I put a post on here previously asking advice about my condition, and I got loads of helpful replies- well since January I have lost an alarming 42lbs, I am getting new pains which have started in my upper back, my shoulders, under my ribs in my ?lungs, also pain when I breathe in, also important for this, I had a seizure last month whilst I was out with my friend, I had 2 glasses of wine and went into a seizure and was unresponsive for a few hours in the hospital, they said my blood results were very bad but didn’t explain how, said I could have been extremely ?intoxicated, another doctor said it could have been a ?hypo seizure, but I’m not diabetic, I was also vomiting coffee grounds whilst I was unconscious.
My condition has worsened to the point where whatever I am eating whether it’s plain food or not I am vomiting up with reflux, I only eat every 2/3 days as I feel I’m developing PTSD from eating, I’m physically scared of the pain and vomiting.. I am getting so low and depressed from what’s going on I’ve thought about suicide.

I had an endoscopy(without the camera) down to test how strong my oesophagus was, I had a barium swallow aswell which both showed up perfect, But I also had an oesophageal pH monitoring test done which is to be kept in for 24hours and you get given a diary and a monitor you’re attached too, which you can record your symptoms in e.g whenever you feel pain, whenever you eat, whenever you lay down and sleep etc; I ended up becoming severely ill when I had this in and had to rip it out after 17 hours as I was projectile vomiting everywhere and in absolute agony.
I had my results back from this test which showed I *DO* have some reflux, but I wasn’t experiencing reflux when I was vomiting, or the pain I was recording wasn’t showing as reflux either..? My doctor has said to me that because of this, if I was to be referred to the surgeons they could reject me as it’s not solid evidence of this being reflux and being treatable from surgery which I’m so upset about...
My doctor has now referred me for another endoscopy camera to go down with biopsy’s (I had an endoscopy 6 years ago which showed nothing) to hope they can see evidence of what’s going on.. but this won’t happen for a while now because they’ve stopped all surgeries and endoscopys during COVID unless it’s an emergency, and there’s a long waiting list... the doctor said to me I would have to become severely underweight or unwell in order for me to become an emergency...

I am beginning to lose the will to live, every day life is a struggle, I have started to vomit red blood, sometimes coffee grounds but not in large quantities, I have headaches, I’m in agony every day now, I am losing 1-2 pound per day depending.

My symptoms start as Sulphur burps, then I get upper abdomen pain, then chest pain going into my back and shoulders, then I will get gassy, frequent loose stool, which I will be rolling around screaming and crying from the pain and projectile vomit everywhere; and the smell of my vomit is more extreme than normal vomit, boyfriend describes it as battery acid with rotten eggs. Have been admitted to hospital multiple times when this happens, and every time I have hypertension.

I’m desperate for answers, please if anyone has any solutions or maybe answers to what’s going on with me? Any tests that I could ask to have? Or any knowledge of what could be happening with me or conditions, it would help so much, me and my family are worried sick and feel I’m slipping through the cracks.

NAD but my mum’s a gastroenterologist. They had a patient with similar symptoms to yours - abdominal pains, vomiting, weight loss, bloating, chest pain, side pains, nausea. Everything was normal. No outcome. One of the doctors mentioned SMA syndrome (Wilkies Syndrome) as well as MALS (Median Arcuate Ligament Syndrome). 

Wilkies syndrome is a rare disorder where the third part of the duodenum is compressed between the superior mesenteric artery (SMA)  and abdominal aorta. The symptoms are burping, nausea and vomiting, bloating, weight loss, feeling full after eating, small bowel obstruction and abdominal pain. 

MALS occurs when the median arcuate ligament compresses the celiac artery and the nerves in the area. The symtoms are constant pain, vomiting, nausea, bloating, body aches, extreme weight loss, epigastric pain after eating. Apparently the pain is similar to that of final stage of pancreating cancer. 

She had both of those, plus some other stuff. I am not a doctor and I don’t know your medical history. But definitely try and call your doctors as many times as you need to get something sorted. I am so sorry you’re in pain.",243,0,

Something happened to me last night (nearly 24 hours ago now).

I’m wondering what exactly goes into assault exams and is there a time frame they have to be done in? 

I already showered and I’m bleeding down there now.


Edit : 

Thank you everyone for the kind and encouraging comments, advice and messages. Sorry I haven’t replied to them all. 

I went to the hospital and am in touch with the appropriate people. 

I just want to give a special shoutout to all nurses and doctors. You guys are genuinely incredible. Your patience and kindness even when I know you have a million things to do and 100’s of other people to deal with is appreciated more than you know.

- I drink alcohol 2-3 times per month / do not smoke or use recreational drugs 

- My current medications are:
Wellbutrin - 300 mg/day
Concerta - 54 mg/day
Corlanor - 10 mg/day
Ajovy - 1 injection/month
Cimzia - 2 injections/month
Ketamine - weekly infusions (administered by doc for depression, unsure of dosing though) 

- I have a medical history of anxiety, depression, Crohn’s disease (well under control), and inappropriate sinus tachycardia 

I sincerely apologize for how long this post is, but I am at my wit’s end and I can’t think of anyone to turn to. My primary has literally given up trying to diagnose me and says there’s nothing she can do. There’s been a lot happening in terms of my health and I’m completely overwhelmed, but I’ll try and keep this as short as I can.

For context/background, approx. 3 months ago I quickly started to develop random symptoms that have left me completely unable to function or live my daily life. Things such as sudden onset of daily migraines, low platelets,  
very high resting heart rate, chronic muscle pain, and relentless fatigue to name a few. I’ve had countless tests performed to try and figure out what’s wrong (MRI/CT of head, neck, and chest, bloodwork for autoimmune markers, bone marrow biopsy, lumbar puncture, Covid tests/antibody tests, echocardiogram) all with essentially normal results, aside from a recent diagnosis of sinus tachycardia (which is being treated and helping to lower my heart rate but not providing much relief to anything else). All of these symptoms have been concerning enough, but aren’t pointing to any solid diagnosis. However, that’s not my main concern at this point...

About 3 weeks ago I began to have soft tinnitus in one ear, which I didn’t think anything of. It slowly grew louder and spread to the other ear, becoming so loud that I’ve lost multiple nights of sleep in a row. Last Monday, as I was watching TV, I noticed the voices began to sound muffled or like a buzzing noise, almost like they were talking through a static radio on low volume. It went away the next day and I tried to ignore it. Since then, it has been becoming progressively worse. It seems to fluctuate pretty drastically. At times I feel like I can hear perfectly well, but sometimes it gets incredibly hard to hear.  During these periods of time, I can’t understand what people are saying on TV (progressively more muffled/static sounding), I can’t hear my SO if we’re out in a loud public place, I can’t tell where sounds are coming from, and sometimes it seems there is even an echo between my two ears. 

Of course, when I went to see an ENT, I was hearing fine and the tests returned normal. At first I thought maybe I was just imagining this, but the worse it gets the more I am convinced that something is genuinely wrong. The ENT was not taking me seriously, but I have never had hearing troubles in my life and I KNOW this is not normal. I’m not regularly exposed to loud noise and I haven’t had any sort of head injury. 

I’m honestly terrified. At the rate this is progressing I am afraid I will lose a significant amount of my hearing before a doctor takes me seriously. I have no idea what to do or who to turn to at this point and I am desperate for any advice on a next step to take.  

Is this something I should actually be concerned about? Am I overreacting? If not, how can I get doctors to take me seriously? 

I would sincerely appreciate any and all input! Thanks in advance everyone :)

EDIT: Holy moly, I did not expect to get so much feedback so quickly! I sincerely appreciate the kind words, input, and advice from all of you :) 
Based on your suggestions I think my loose plan moving forward will be:
- mention all of this to my neurologist at our follow up next week (I haven’t seen her in a month) 
- Speak with my psychiatrist about the Wellbutrin. I will say that I’ve been talking this for almost 4 years with no prior issues, but it’s still worth a shot to mention!
- Start keeping a diary of my symptoms and see if I can make a correlation to the cause of the hearing loss episodes

423,Post,gnd2hx,22M. I have ADHD. I have felt tremendously numb and unmotivated for the past month. I tried nicotine for the first time and it really helped me. I’m not sure what to do with that information,thegman987,This user has not yet been verified.,1589987402.0,"Update: Nicotine was only helpful to me while I was still on Vyvanse and in withdrawal after stopping Vyvanse and stopping trazadone (an anticholinergic). Most of my symptoms have decreased significantly (although not completely, I’m not numb anymore but still sleepy and not completely functional a lot) and so nicotine is now barely beneficial for me. So I know most of you did not actually care whether or not my symptoms improved or if my suffering decreased and solely cared about me not doing nicotine, so you will be happy to know that I no longer have a reason to do nicotine and won’t. 
For people who are also on Vyvanse, I found out from Dr. Russell Barkley that it can suppress the limbic system and therefore your emotions over time. 

READ BEFORE COMMENTING: Can smokers please stop commenting about how I shouldn’t do nicotine because they regret smoking? Smoking tobacco and having a nicotine lozenge are different things. And I am really disappointed that I’ve gotten so many comments and the vast majority of them are so unhelpful and just telling me “don’t do it” and not offering me some alternative when I just told you I was suffering emotionally and suffering in my school work for 1.5 months and was completely numb. I’m literally failing almost every single class just because of the lack of work I was able to get through in the last 2 weeks, which will cost me like $20k. So please do not project onto me your smoker’s guilt, I posted on here to find out if there was an alternative I should look into. It doesn’t even seem like most of you have bothered to read my description.



So this is a very odd situation.
I’ve been doing pretty poorly in school during quarantine. I’ve been feeling very numb and unmotivated. I was on 20 mg in Vyvanse and then 40 mg of Vyvanse. On 20 mg I realized I wasn’t getting the focus benefits of Vyvanse. On 40 mg I was getting the focus benefits to some extent, but the come down was really hard and even thought it helped me focus, there was something about it that made me feel mentally slower. No matter what dosage of Vyvanse I was on, I felt really numb and unmotivated inside and it prevented me from being productive. It didn’t matter how much coffee or how much Vyvanse I had, it was like my body just stopped reacting to adrenaline. This has happened to me in past semesters as well, so it’s not just a quarantine thing. This even happened to me last semester while I was on 15 mg of lexapro.

I heard nicotine worked on acetylcholine receptors and my friend talked a lot about how much she loved nicotine. I decided I had nothing left to lose with how numb I felt inside and how poorly I was doing in school, so I bought 2 mg of nicotine lozenges. I sucked on half of it and took it out while I was trying to work at my friends place. I was also on 20 mg of Vyvanse at the time, but it was about 8 pm so it was close to the end of the duration.

And all of a sudden, I felt joy again. After a month of numbness and feeling like I was being dragged through the rest of the semester and barely eating because I was so bored of the idea of making another decision about what to eat. And it was such a relief, because I didn’t know when I was ever going to stop feeling numb again and I felt like I was barely a human and suddenly it was like I could breathe. My thoughts were finally moving at a normal speed. I felt motivation and I wanted to do my work and I did. 

And I don’t know what to do with that information. I don’t know if that means I should be trying out a certain type of antidepressant. I tried bupropion XL 150 mg for 1-2 months before and it made me had sporadic moments of hearing my pulse in my ear (but I had also just stopped using Vyvanse and I know Vyvanse had raised my blood pressure since I started using it). It had also made me a little irritated and I didn’t really see benefits from it. But maybe I didn’t give it enough time or didn’t use it a high enough dosage? 

Or I don’t know if I should start using nicotine gum medicinally 1-2 times a week. I know it has a high addiction rate and I don’t want it to downregulate any of my neurotransmitters. But it doesn’t have the same harms as smoking. But as far as I can tell, there really aren’t prescription drugs that work out there quite like nicotine. 

I just feel like now that I know that it’s possible for me to function like a normal and functioning person again, I need to try to figure out how to do it with a safer drug. 

I haven’t tried atomoxetine before, I don’t know if that’s something I should try

Male, age 64, caucasian.  Don't smoke or drink. No serious drugs, minor casual cannibis in 30s.  BMI is 25. Modest regular exercise.

&#x200B;

BACKGROUND:

Around early 2000s - my early to mid 40s - I had minor diarrhea and constipation.

I saw gastroenterologist around 2001 or 2002.  He said ""...nothing serious...eating too much junk food...eat more fiber""

I took his advice.  Digestive symptoms decreased for a while, then increased during 2009, 2010.

&#x200B;

CRISIS:

Suddenly, in Nov 2011 - at age 53 - I started experiencing

\* Headches, centered around right eye

\* Extreme fatigue

\* Vision loss - scotomas in right eye

\* Sensitivity to heat and light.

\* Parasthesia of hands and feet.

&#x200B;

ATTEMPTS AT DIAGNOSIS:

It took many months to get things sorted out

One doc assumed heart attack.  I had electrocardiogram, it showed that my heart was okay.  Was tested for diabetes.  That was negative.  Saw eye doc at Koch Eye Center. Extensive tests showed that right eyeball was okay.

No progress was being made.

&#x200B;

I was living in Northeastern LA county at the time, so I transferred to UCLA.  ( I figured  that I would get the best rated medical care on this side of the Mississippi, even if it meant two hours of LA traffic each way. Sometimes my wife would drive me. )

&#x200B;

UCLA docs decided that it was a neurological problem.

Had VEP ( visual evoked potental ) test, showed substantial damage to right optic nerves.  Based upon VEP results, was given diagnosis of MS by UCLA neurologist.

But two MRIs showed no lesions in brain or spinal cord.

Neurologist still maintained that I had MS, but that the lesions hadn't shown up yet.  Second neurologist - also UCLA - agreed.   Apparently my VEP results and parasthesia were a textbook presentation of MS.

&#x200B;

( At this point - about mid 2013, almost two years after onset of neuro symptoms - the scotomas had subsided, but I was still experiencing headaches, fatigue, parasthesia, and sensitivity to heat and light; plus continuing gastointestinal problems. )

&#x200B;

But, given the negative MRIs, the docs were amenable to listening to alternatives.

I suggested gastro problems as the cause.   Was checked for diverticulitis, tested negative.  Was tested for celiac, tested negative.  Had camera endoscopy, showed lymphangiectasia.

But they could make no connection between the lymphangiectasia and the neurological symptoms.

&#x200B;

One of the nurses in UCLA gastro office quietly suggested checking for food allergies.  The docs would not approve a skin prick test.

I started a FODMAP diet, and gastroinestinal symptoms decreased greatly.   I finally realized that I was reacting to gluten, despite what celiac test said.   I started testing myself for food allergies by trial and error.  This showed a handful of foods to which I had allergies or intolerances.

&#x200B;

TENTATIVE DIAGNOSIS:

At this point, food allergies led me to think that there might be an inherited genetic component to it.

In her 40s and onward, my mother had parasthesias, heat and light intolerance, and food allergies.  She had eventually died at age 73 from myleodisplasia.

I realized - with the discovery of food allergies - that my medical profile was beginning to look like my mother's.  I didn't like the trend, since the last thing on her chart was fatal.

&#x200B;

So I looked up differential diagnosis of myleodisplasia.  The primary DD is copper deficiency.  I looked through my mother's records, found that nobody had ever checked her copper levels.   ( Yes, my mother may have died in a modern hosital from an easily treatable digestive deficiency.  But that is water under the bridge. Can't bring her back. )

Armed with this, I went to my doc, asked for a copper test.  She told me that it was not necessary, that nobody has copper deficiencies.

I insisted.  So I got the test.  It was positive.  I was copper deficient.  Doc then said take 2.5 mg copper supplements, for thirty days, then we will test again.  I took them as advised, went back for the second test.  It was still low. So she doubled it to 5mg every day.  Another thirty days later, a third test showed copper levels just barely inside the low end of normal.

Copper deficiency, as some here may know, causes nerve damage similar to MS.  So we had a tentative diagnosis.  ( The neurologist at UCLA had no comment )

&#x200B;

STASIS:

Thus, around 2014, we had reached a stable situation:

I was taking copper supplements, eating carefully to avoid allergies/intolerances.  Digestive symptoms were slowly getting better over the years.  Neuro symptoms were not.

My vision was mostly healed ( except for reds - all shades of red looked the same )

I was stuck with a permanent set of symptoms of nerve damage: heat intolerance ( anything above 75F left me fatigued and stumbling like a drunk ), light intolerance, parasthesia, daily headaches.

Docs had told me that nerve damage was irrepairable and permanent.

They gave me Modfinil and Armodafinil to maintain alertness, and a disabled parking permit so that I could avoid heat in parking lots.

I had the air conditioning on almost all the time, both house and car.  I kept the windows closed and the shades down all the time.  If I went out, it was usually at night, or at least near dusk.

I lived like a vampire.

Cold, cloudy days were a temporary reprieve. I seriously considered moving to Seattle just for the weather.

That was my life for years.

&#x200B;

THE TWIST:

In addition to the medical problems above, in 2022 I had begun to observe that I was losing muscle mass as I aged.  So I looked at various supplements.  Steroids all appeared dangerous.  But creatine looked safe, and cheap.

I ordered a bag of it online, and began taking it, starting with 3.75 mg ( one teaspoon ) mid-morning on August 10th.  I continued with another teaspoon in the morning on the 11th.

On the evening of the 11th, I was playing my usual near-dusk game of volleyball. ( I would usually play the last game or two before dark, and thereby get some exercise. I would get fatigued and mentally fuzzy, but I could recover by sitting in the car with the AC on full blast as the sky turned dark. )

But this time I wasn't getting fuzzy.  Despite being warm from exercise, and being in sunlight, I was feeling okay.  I called it a fluke, and cooled off for a bit, then drove home.

Driving home, the brake lights of the car in front of me looked different.  I was seeing shades of red that I had not seen in a decade. Most of the symptoms of nerve damage had just disappeared.  For that evening and part of the next day I was wondering if I had been hallucinating.

&#x200B;

It is now six weeks later. I have continued with 1 teaspon of creatine daily. I have no sensitivity to light any more.  I have tried being in bright light, even with bulbs that emit lots of blue light.  It poses no problems.  Recent heat waves have given me the opportunity to be in 100F heat.  It is not a problem either, whereas 77F used to be disabling.  The daily headaches are gone, as are any parasthesias.

&#x200B;

THE QUESTION:

**What is going on here?**

**I have had symptoms of nerve damage to the point of being disabled.  The damage has been verified with a VEP test.  And docs at a top notch medical establishment have diagnosed me with MS.**

**Yet within 30 hours of taking modest doses of creatine, much of it disappeared. Within two weeks, virtually all symptoms have disappeared.**

**Why is this happening?  And is it permanent?**

&#x200B;

EPILOG:

I suppose a logical scientist would discontinue the creatine, and see if the neuro symptoms would return.  But I'm still taking a teaspoon of creatine every day.  I'm scared to quit.  It is just too good to be normal again.",407,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/xmfigd/creatine_apparently_eliminates_alleged_ms_symptoms/

Been in pain for a little over a year.

No other medical issues.

Only meds I take is hormonal birth control. (Linessa 28) — been on it for 13 years.

Symptoms:
- fatigue
- waking up 3x during the night for no reason
- slight back pain
- stabbing pains occasionally in abdominal area, sometimes off to the left or right side
- abdominal pain/bloating that doesn’t pass
- vulvar burning/itching
- urethra burning/itching
- itchy anus
- mucus surrounding stool
- painful intercourse &amp;amp;amp; especially after
- painful urination that is worse after intercourse
- frequency — feeling like I need to go after I just went.
- very little watery vaginal mucous with very small white spots in it. 

I have seen multiple urologists, Doctors and a gynaecologist. None who want to test me for any deeper infections. I was only referred to do a Urine culture after visiting 4 doctors, so I’m a little concerned that there may be something deeper here.

2 urologists, 1 urogyno &amp; 1 OBGYN

I’ve been tested for chlamydia, tricomonasis, yeast and I’ve done a urine culture and all is normal. There were some ketones shown in my culture, and I do notice some oil floating on my urine.

I had a cystoscopy and ultrasound by a urologist which was also normal. The only thing found was microscopic hematuria. I tried pelvic floor therapy — there was nothing wrong with my pelvic floor. I tried everything prescribed for interstitial cystitis, nothing worked. Elmiron caused me more pain. I even tried the IC diet.

It was noticed that I have a urethral caruncle, but apparently that isn’t causing my symptoms as per 2 urologists that I saw. I tried treating it with estrogen cream with no luck. 

A year prior to my symptoms I had a blood test to rule out diabetes, and my family doesn’t have a history of it.

I have done a vulvar skin biopsy — I don’t have my results yet.",409,190,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/jqx5un/help_abdominal_pain_painfulfrequent_urination_is/

I have not been able to walk more than a block since last January, and the doctors are puzzled as to why. It feels like I am doing a spilt, and both internally and externally (when I press on the area) as if a piece of my perineum has ripped out. It started after I pressed on the shaft of my penis while erect (pressed like a lever).

At first, right after I pressed down on the shaft, it was painful right where the top of the shaft meets the skin of the pelvis, and internally between my legs. The perrineum was swollen for a couple days, but that went away as did the pain in the shaft. After a couple of months the pain went down, but it felt like there was a hollow cavity between my legs, as if there was no support in my pelvis, and upon pressing on my perineum there is indeed a depression there.

I have taken every test and scan in the book, and my penis, testicles, bladder, colon, and prostate are all fine. Please help.

Edit: Thank you everyone for all your help. I unfortunately am not very optimistic, because I have tried so much already.

Had a bottle of vodka smashed on his head 4 years ago, I’m not sure if it was a concussion but he had to have stitches. 


We were on the train, talking as usual. I offered him a mint and he said okay and held out his hand. I put it in his hand and I noticed he stopped moving. He was extremely still, the mint still In his hand. I looked at his face and he looked like he was staring off into space thinking about something very very hard so I looked at him and asked if he’s okay. I thought he was pranking me or was just lost deep in thought. 2 minutes pass and he’s still not moving, still staring into oblivion. Passengers board on and off the train, someone tripped over the umbrella that was in his other hand and I had to apologize and pick up the umbrella. That’s when I realized he wasn’t playing around with me. I start touching his face and calling his name, nothing. I moved the mints from his hand, which was still in that palm.faced up position from when he put his hand out to receive them. Then all of a sudden, as if he was under water and finally came up for air; he let out the biggest gasp and finally regained consciousness of his surroundings. 

It was like one of those gasps in those scary movies movies when someone leaves their body and re-enters. 

He looked at me and I asked him if he was ok and he said yes... so we got off the train, and we had to take another one after and while we were walking to it I noticed it happened again. He was staring off into oblivion, his eyes open normally, he looked completely normal, it was only when I called his name and he didn’t respond that I realized something was wrong again. We were about to get on the train and I held his arm and he was stiff and standing still and I tried to push him to come sit down on a nearby bench with me to which his body finally seemed to loosen up a bit and I was able to easily guide him there. We sat there and he was in this state for another 6-7 minutes.  Then, again, just as I was about to call the ambulance, he gasps again and eyes open wide as he just regained consciousness again and me and a nearby security guard started asking him if he’s okay and he said he was perfectly fine, we went about the rest of our evening, got food, it was a good time. I told him about it and he doesn’t believe me.  Tried to google it and I see absence seizures only last 15 seconds.. I am just scared and so worried for him please help. He keeps laughing at me and telling me that I am crazy and he doesn’t believe me and it’s so frustrating.

EDIT- I was wondering does anyone have any input about the gasping? I have seen my brother during an absence seizure but he never gasps when he regained consciousness. Has anyone of you ever witnessed/experienced that before?

Edit: to reiterate, I HAVE directly asked for some kind of analgesic (stronger than Tylenol). Would I be here otherwise?!

Edit 2: food for thought - after my first IUD, I ALSO said to the doctor that it wasn’t that bad, because she had spent so much time telling me I’d just feel “a little pinch” or “a little pressure,” and that “most patients report the subsequent mild cramping to be the worst part.” You know why I said it wasn’t that bad? Because she made me feel like an absolute wimp for being in so much pain, and I WAS EMBARRASSED. How many other patients do we think did the exact same thing??

Edit 3: I was going to delete this after getting an answer, but I think it’s important that the dismissive attitudes of the physicians and the innumerable anecdotes from patients should stay up pretty much forever. This situation is incredibly shitty and SHOULD NOT HAPPEN. It’s downright bad medicine to put patients through something they KNOW will be excruciatingly painful when there are so many options for pain control - we just choose not to use them in the US.

464,Post,kqxfr4,Please help me to protect my sister. She has secondary breast cancer and her immune system is compromised.,alexander_london,Layperson/not verified as healthcare professional.,1609849248.0,"The patient:
Age: 31
Weight: Over 10 stone.
Location: UK
Past medical history: Nothing major, kidney stones, whiplash
Current medical history: Secondary breast cancer, ER+, HER-, I think luminal A. 
Current meds: Palbociclib, denosumab, goserelin (zoladex), letrozole

Hi guys, thanks for your time. I think this subreddit is incredible and I appreciate everything you all do.
The situation is this: my sister was diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer about 3 months ago and has been put on targeted biotherapy drugs, such as palbociclib. These have significantly damaged her immune system to the point that they've had to pause her treatment. Now, obviously the meds are the main cause of this but she's also grown quite obese, is stressed out and is going outside for walks in the cold every day.

In an attempt to restore her immune system enough that she can resume her life-saving treatment, I have been doing some research and it seems the consensus shows that exposure to cold weather does inhibit immune function. When I tried to show this to her and her fiancé, dissuading them from going outside/on walks every day, the response was essentially, ""she's wrapped up warm so it doesn't count as exposure"", ""I need it for my mental health"" etc. Frustratingly, a nurse also said that there's 'nothing we can do to restore your immune system'.

For my peace of mind, can you guys give me your two cents on this? Beyond healthy eating, is there really nothing we can do?

Thanks.

your immune system *can* be reduced by the cold, especially over a long time of exposure, but I highly doubt the effect of a bundled up walk on a cold day would outweigh the huge benefits of exercise, sunlight and outside time, and time with her fiance. I wouldn't recommend she purposefully get cold, or remain outside when it's uncomfortable, but generally if she feels comfortable and happy with the routine (which it sounds like she does), there's really not any medical evidence to stop.

walking in the cold can be beneficial to circulation, activation of ""good fat"" storage, and helping the body adapt more easily to future changing temperatures

I will get back to everyone after work 


Sorry for formatting, on mobile. 

Its 3am and I can't sleep bc I am anxious. 


49M

Unknown weight 

Unknown height 

White

Existing medical condition: 
- atrial fibrillation 
- something was wrong w his thyroid 27-ish years ago and he had it removed

Chronic alcoholic for well over 20 years. Quit alcohol cold Turkey a few months ago when this all happened.
Smokes A LOT.

As for medication he is on thyroid meds but not sure what kind. 
On lots of pain meds atm so I'm not sure which ones they keep changing. 


A couple months ago my dad hurt his foot at work. Everything went downhill from there. Even though his foot healed the pain didn't. It wasn't too bad he could still go to work his feet would just hurt after. 

Forward a few weeks later and he had constant pain in his legs and was unwell.
He was admitted to hospital for a few days and was discovered to have pancreatitis. Stayed in hospital till he was well and was discharged. He was meant to have an endoscopy but couldn't as he had to have a stress test (which had to be cancelled bc he ended up in hospital)

Had the stress test. His feet were too sore to run on the treadmill so he had to have the injection. Can still walk normally at this point, just painful. Heart is healthy apart from atrial fibrillation which we knew about before the stress test. 

Now he can barely walk. And when he does he almost falls. The pain in  feet and legs is unbearable. I believe the doctors said he has 'alcoholic neuropathy' and the nerves in his feet are dying. Nothing they can do about it but pain management. 

They found a blockage in one leg 


I will list all symptoms now as this will turn into a 3 part novel if I keep going. The one thing I do mention is a lot of it sounds like alcoholic neuropathy but I'm not sure if ALL symptoms are it. And thanks to my health anxiety I'm second guessing the doctors, since they've said so many different things that I won't bother listing here bc it's too long.

 He has been in and out of hospital 4 times this week. He has been a lot the past month. 

- extreme pain in legs and feet, hard to walk, always needs to hold onto something to walk, can't drive 
- pins and needles in feet 
- feet are turning white? 
- legs are an odd colour (purple-ish)
- insomnia. He has cat naps now and then but no actual sleep. It's been 1-2 weeks since he has had a proper sleep. He said its from the pain.
- has barely eaten, if at all, says its from the pain 
- has lost 10-12kg since getting sick 
- rash all over body, purple and spotty in some parts lines in others 
- blood in urine which drs say is infection and has been given antibiotics
- occasional pins n needles in fingers/hands

Is prostate cancer likely? Could the drs be right with alcoholic neuropathy? 

He goes hospital bc he is in pain in his legs, they do blood tests and gets sent home. 


Thanks if anyone takes time to read this and respond.

Edit: his blood tests at first came back as infection somewhere in the body but not sure where

He has been to the ER 4 times this week.,TalkNeurology,Physician,2021-01-04 17:41:10,"Chronic alcohol use can cause pancreatitis, neuropathy, and heart failure (so-called alcoholic dilated cardiomyopathy). The latter is strongly associated with atrial fibrillation, so I'd suspect that to be the case for your dad.

The rash you're describing sounds to me like livedo reticularis, which can be associated with coagulopathy and venous thrombosis, among other things. I'd google that and see whether you agree. I also agree with the other docs that another issue could be vascular insufficiency.

The neuropathy may be directly due to alcohol or precipitated indirectly by vitamin deficiencies that occur frequently among heavy drinkers. Thiamine deficiency and B12 deficiency both cause a neuropathy and can be sometimes partially reversed or at least not progressed by supplementation.

Things I'd personally want to make sure he had done:

\- A CT or ultrasound of his abdomen to evaluate for cirrhosis (associated with clotting disorders, which would explain his rash and DVT)

\- Serum levels of B12 (cobalamin) and B1 (thiamine)

\- Ensure he's on supplementation for both of those vitamins as well

\- Ensure he doesn't forget about his endoscopy, on the off chance his pancreatitis and weight loss have a more grim cause

\- Agree with eval for peripheral artery disease (probably would begin with ABIs)

\- For symptom control, I'd try gabapentin and a topical lidocaine cream for particular problem areas, if there isn't skin breakdown (capsaicin cream also helps but is tedious to apply frequently)

All 4 professionals I've spoken with went into great detail how it's going to be extremely painful for about 8 weeks. There is no avaliable support system to answer my questions.

485,Comment,en76pf,Being told by surgeon and other medical professionals that my surgery and recovery will be extremely painful and it's starting to freak me out. Considering bailing.,Radicalopathy,Physician,2020-01-11 18:39:42,"This thread is filled with ""NAD"" comments giving questionable information and advice. Here is some feedback based off of my experience at our institution. 

It is hard to tell from your post what your actual problem is and what actual procedure they are planning on doing. Internal and external hemorrhoids, fistulas and abscesses are all different things, but may be all present at the same time. There is a very wide range of procedures used to repair all these issues, some of which are more painful than others. Based off of multiple providers telling you to expect pain I would hazard a guess that they are planning on an open hemroiddectomy, plus possibly other procedures depending on if they find fistulas or abscesses intraop. You can Google some images of hemorrhoidectomy, but I'll warn you that it is very hard to understand what they do unless you have actually seen one and the pictures look the procedure look a good deal more horrible than it actually is.

You should expect to be quite sore because it is a very sensitive area, but to claim that you will be in excruciating pain for 8 weeks is an exaggeration. The surgeons at my hospital do give out more pain medicine for these sorts of procedures than they do for any other colorectal surgeries or other general surgeries, but that being said, these procedures are very common and people get through them with medication and guidance from the surgical team. 

Is this truly a necessary surgery? I can't tell you that without seeing you, but I think it's a fair bet that if multiple people have told you you need an operation that you probably do. Hemorrhoids past a certain severity are not likely to improve on their own, and if you don't have them fixed you may be dealing with them for a very long time. Get another opinion if it will help put your mind at rest, but it's probably worth it. I WOULD recommend that you have it performed by a colorectal specialist surgeon, not by a general surgeon. Some other comments mention postop complications which can occur with even the best surgeon, but are much less common when these procedures are performed by fellowship trained colorectal surgeons. 

Best of luck.",350,0,

Prior to the procedure, please inform him you were **told by the staff** it will be an extremely painful procedure & being that you have anxiety disorder this is making you feel uncomfortable about it.

I have an itchy anus that makes me want to wipe aggressively. When I do so, it feels incredibly good, but I notice that there are small, light red, bloody marks on the toilet paper. Minutes to hours later, I notice a clear, watery liquid on the area of my anus where I recently wiped. It’s a very small amount and does not smell bad (or of anything really) when it initially appears. Almost like a layer of dewy sweat. But it’s not sweat. After about 12-18 hours, I notice that my shorts smell horrible in that area—I can’t quite describe it but think homeless person/extremely bad BO. The smell gets on other surfaces where I sit, like my office chair, sofa, etc. To top it all off, my anus continues to itch and it’s like a perfect storm of anal itching, rawness, and that god-forsaken clear dew that makes my clothes and everything they touch smell of putrid BO.

I’ve found that I can sort of manage the issue by using a bidet so that I don’t have to wipe very much. By using the bidet and dabbing my anus dry with toilet paper when finished, I don’t have much of a problem with the clear watery fluid, but I still occasionally see red marks with light wiping and experience sporadic itching. The soreness tends to be located at the very tip of my anus nearest the perineum and is usually where I notice the clear liquid coming out. The itching is solely located on the right side of my anus, seemingly beneath the surface.

I’ve talked to my GP about the issue and was referred to a surgeon for hemorrhoid evaluation. The surgeon did not find anything of note and recommended that I just use witch hazel wipes. He also didn’t have any idea about the clear watery fluid.

I feel trapped by my situation. I don’t feel comfortable traveling. I don’t feel comfortable using a public restroom. I’ve tried portable bidets but they don’t seem to function well enough to address my problems. Besides, I feel that the bidet is only a band-aid to my problem, not a cure.

Any idea what my problem could be? I’d be forever indebted to whoever helps me solve this. Thanks!",2,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1cewon5/help_me_34m_figure_out_whats_going_on_with_my/

506,Post,1ceync3,34F back pain - will core exercises really help,Awesomocity0,Layperson/not verified as healthcare professional,1714281628.0,"Hi doctors, 

I got into an accident about five years ago where my leg was shattered, and I got hardware put in. Doctor never sent me to rehab. Said I was doing well enough on my own. 

Well, once I was walking more and more on my own, I noticed that whenever I would walk a bit longer, I would start to get sharp pain in my back, not my leg. The pain would be so bad it'd make me see stars and sweat, and I'd have to sit down. I went to a back doctor who said I had arthritis and some degenerative stuff going on and put me on some temporary steroids and said I'd be fine.

I ended up pregnant and didn't follow up. Post pregnancy, I followed up with a doctor who did a more through exam (asked me to show him some movements and pushed around in places).

He's sending me to PT and also told me he thinks the issue is a weak core. He said if I do some of the list of exercises daily (stuff like planking), that the pain will decrease significantly. I don't exercise my core individually, but I do already bike regularly. 

Is it really possible that just working out my core will make this severe back pain that makes me break out in a sweat during a twenty minute grocery store trip go away? I'm doing the exercises and PT either way but just feel skeptical that it will help that much. 

And how is it that this pain only started after my leg surgery?

Any thoughts appreciated.

Ice it frequently, alternate ibuprofen 600-800mg (unless you're taking oral ketorolac, if it was an injection at the office that's fine) and Tylenol 650-1000mg every 3 hours for max effect. ETA if you are taking oral ketorolac you can take 1000mg Tylenol every 6 hours. 


Over the counter salon pas lidocaine patches or arnica gel might help too. 


You didn't say what you broke in your shoulder or when. It no need to be trying to range of motion over your head early on just rest it, I imagine you have a sling, that allows rest. It's normal for an injury to feel warm due to inflammation.

This situation is taking a toll on my mental health and confidence. Any guidance on medication or treatment would be greatly appreciated.

517,Post,1cerrz7,Bony bump on the side of my knee + the medical menagerie that is my life right now.,abugwithathrowaway,Layperson/not verified as healthcare professional,1714259492.0,"18F, 133 lb & 5'3"", in Canada. I am diagnosed with ADHD, ASD, POTS, and Narcolepsy (type 2). I take 40mg of Vyvanse daily (started 3 years ago) and 100mg of Modafinil twice daily (started in March). I have also been diagnosed with hypermobility (full Beighton score) & my doctor is looking into connective tissue disorders now that I've received the POTS diagnosis. 

**For a lot of these issues I'm just waiting on tests or appointments to find out what's wrong, so I hopefully** ***will*** **find out eventually, but I just wanted to hear people's thoughts on what's going on and how worried I should be.**

Now for the knee situation- a couple of weeks ago, I walked out of my room and noticed that my left knee felt off and hurt to walk on. This is pretty normal for me, my joints will feel ""off"" randomly and then fix themselves eventually, but the fact that it hurt confused me. While feeling around, I noticed that it felt like a bone was sticking out more than normal in the lower right area of my left knee. I felt both knees simultaneously and yes, while on the right knee I could feel that sort of rounded bone on the medial side, the left knee has it sticking out *way* more. It's hard like a bone, not a cyst. I can't tell if it really moves; there's a sort of clicking/grinding when I'll press and move the skin over it, but that might just be the feeling of the veins moving over it? I went to physio today and brought it up. He spent a long time feeling around my knee and moving it in different ways, to which there wasn't much pain except when pushing on the bone-thing itself. He ultimately told me that it was definitely hard like bone, to make an appointment with my doctor and that she'd probably have me do an x-ray (am now waiting for said appointment). 

One of the questions he asked me was if I had any sudden weight loss, to which I said no. **I feel like I should've said yes**- I don't think I've *recently* lost weight super suddenly, but as of June last year I weighed \~145-150 lbs, and now I weigh 133. I don't really exercise or walk much at *all* (trying to get better at that) and I haven't made any sort of lifestyle changes that would cause that. I just sort of attributed this to my Vyvanse, as it really reduces my appetite when it's active, but lately (I'd say maybe the past month or two) my appetite has gone almost completely. It's not nausea, but if I go into the kitchen and look at food there's nothing in me that wants to eat it. It's constant, even when my Vyvanse has worn off, and I know that I'm not getting enough food. Most days I won't eat at all until having just a small portion of dinner, and some recent days I haven't even wanted dinner. I haven't ever been the type of person to weigh themselves regularly so I don't know if I *have* lost more weight recently, but when I look in the mirror it does feel like I've changed faster recently compared to it being more spread out over the last year. 

As for something that could possibly be connected to the weight loss instead- a year ago I had a head & neck CT scan, and the tech/whoever looked at the scans made a note that there was some sort of soft tissue where my thymus is, but they couldn't get a good look as it wasn't a chest CT. That was a year ago and for some reason they never followed up on that, but when I recently went to Internal Medicine for the POTS diagnosis, they looked at all my scans and told my doctor and I that I should get a chest CT to check it out. I am currently waiting on that appointment.

I also about a month ago had some stroke-like symptoms; sharp headache, flat vision and vertigo the night before, and then left-sided numbness + an inability to talk for like 30 minutes etc. The doctor in the ER didn't take me seriously at all, said it was anxiety, and I had to convince him to order a CT scan (which came back clear). They referred me to the neurologist afterwards who took me seriously and has had me take baby aspirin daily ""just in case"" and ordered a MRI (which is tonight! yay!). The left side of my body still has way less sensation than the right, with some areas still being almost numb, which is why I don't think it was a hemiplegic migraine.

I can see this coming off as me being anxious or a hypochondriac, but I promise I'm not. Everything that I've been diagnosed with was because I noticed something, *extensively* researched and read through medical journals, and then brought it up with my doctor. When I think I may have a condition and then realize there's core symptoms/criteria I don't have, I let it go. I don't see the point in convincing myself I have something that I don't, and I just want to have the most information possible because there is no one else who's going to advocate for me. I've had too many doctors just dismiss me because they don't want to admit they don't know everything. 

**Please feel free to ask any questions**, I'm aware that you might need more info and I have practically nothing to do while waiting for these tests. Sorry for the long post, I know this is a lot to read. Thank you.",2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1cerrz7/bony_bump_on_the_side_of_my_knee_the_medical/

About a year ago, I began to suffer from severe constipation. I was unable to go to the bathroom more than once a week without an enema or laxative. I went to my doc and have tried numerous medicines, regimes, none of which have been successful. She sent me for a CT scan with contrast and it showed wall thickening of the sigmoid colon and a colonoscopy was recommended. I saw a GI who did not want to do a colonoscopy because I had one a year and a half ago. 2 benign polyps were removed at this time. That colonoscopy was a 3 year follow up to one I had before in which polyps were removed. The GI had me try a few more medications which did not work. In the meantime, I began experiencing blood in my stool about 3-4 times a month. I was given a steroid cream for hemorrhoids (no other symptoms of them). This did not work. Upon follow up, I was sent for a colon transit study which came back normal. At no time has my doctor physically looked at me or felt my stomach. He said the wall thickening is normal and doesn’t indicate anything. I have gained 20 pounds over the last year. After eating, it looks like I am very pregnant and have even been asked when I am due. My current symptoms still included constipation, occasional bleeding, bloating, feeling like I am not fully able to go. I am miserable and feel like no one is listening. I don’t feel like it is normal to only go to the bathroom once a week on your own. I have had multiple abdominal surgeries so I think about adhesions and of course cancer (dad died from it at age 69). It is so hard to get into new doctors because they book you so far out. I was diagnosed with Hashimoto’s years ago and in October started on levothyroxine (88mcg). The constipation issue started in May of 2023. Last summer my thyroid was hyper for a bit before it went hypo. At no time did I suffer from diarrhea so my endo says it is not related. Any suggestions?

529,Post,1ceucf2,Are my sudden symptoms from brain surgery recovery? Or is it hydrocephalus again?,HauntedCaffeine,Layperson/not verified as healthcare professional,1714266979.0,"Hey everyone!

I’m 22F, diagnosed with hydrocephalus, asthma and Tourette’s syndrome.

Almost two months ago, I got ETV brain surgery for hydrocephalus. It was caused by severe aqueductal stenosis. Nobody knows what caused the stenosis, it kinda came out of no where. I was experiencing symptoms for about a month before I ended up in the hospital.

My MRI report also said that there was slight circumferential T2/FLAIR hyper-intensity and tiny nodularity at the inferior aspect of the quadrigeminal plate (I have no idea what any of this means btw)

Before I got brain surgery, I had symptoms like pressure in the head, tingling in my arms and legs, loss of sensation in my face, vertigo, nausea, headaches, eye strain, fatigue, slurred speech, anxiety/depression, mood swings and poor coordination.  

Things have been okay for a while besides recovery being difficult; however, last week some of the symptoms flared up again out of no where. While not as bad as before, I feel slight tingling in my legs. I’m also fatigued and lost a lot of motivation to do things, I’m having vertigo again and it’s making me nauseous (like I’m swaying on a boat), and I’ve had constant headaches. I’ve been having horrible mood swings as well. 

My concern is the ETV closing up, but I just got an MRI last month and everything was fine, and I don’t feel pressure in my head. My friend mentioned getting tested for MS, but I don’t know.",1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1ceucf2/are_my_sudden_symptoms_from_brain_surgery/

So what is my problem? 

I was diagnosed with bursitis 3 days ago. Pain was mild, no fever. Doctor in Urgent Care gave me an elbow pad. Told me to take off the elbow pad in 2 days and that he wouldn't give me anything for pain or treatment because it's not a painful condition,  nothing paracetamol won't cure (which, like, I wasn't asking for  pain pills because Im on Tylex and  Lyrica so idc but perhaps  some kind of steroid injection treatment?) and that it'll pass on its own. That night I had 38.8°C temperature, I felt awful. Pain got so bad I couldn't move my arm much. Still can't. 

I feel absolutely terrible. I feel I'm getting worse. My temperature keeps going to 39°C. My arm ls bright  red and  hot. Hurts a ton. But he said it'll pass on its own and the elbow pad I had for 2 days will do the trick.

It didn't.

I want to ask a few questions: 

- should I see someone else? Like, am I just overreacting and it perhaps just will pass on its own? I'm asking because Google said that this can be treated with things like injections but I've been told to stop Googling my conditions because it's often a case by case type deal.. so perhaps for some reason I just can't. 

- given my other conditions, would bursitis be a risk to me by any means? I'm asking because like I know, for example,  things  like untreated infections can cause endocarditis in people who have Mitral and Aortic valves replaced to metallic ones. But I might be wrong so I'm sorry if I am.

- given my medication, specifically warfarin, could I realistically be given an injection for this? 

I'm so sorry for the long post. I'm just worried about this and I wanted some reassurance. Thank you in advance.

She has had no actual medical issues I am aware of and yes I am posting this with her consent. I am not sure if this is the proper place to answer my question so I am sorry if it is not. Emglish is not my first language so excuse that please. I am wondering if an emergency contact is able to access any type of medical records in the hospital.

Is this something hospitals normally do? Me and my friend lived in Mexico before this and her sister did not, they are estranged and met up for the first time in a very long time years ago.

536,Post,1cet03o,Excessive thirst for 3 years with other odd symptoms developing ,desperatepers0n,Layperson/not verified as healthcare professional,1714262915.0,"(From my friend’s mom who doesn’t have Reddit) My daughter (18F) has had excessive thirst for 3 years now. It wasn’t bad at the beginning but now it’s gotten so bad to the point where she has to get up a minimum of 3-4 times a night either to pee or to drink more water. It is not just dry mouth and we have already seen multiple specialists but no one can figure it out. 

It’s not diabetes and her electrolytes don’t show an imbalance. She’s also had her thyroid and PTH tested and they’re in the normal range. However, whenever we get a new test done it shows she’s somehow dehydrated. I don’t understand how because she drinks an abnormal amount of water everyday. 

A few weeks ago she all of a sudden became super nearsighted in one of her eyes to the point where it’s 20/80 and it’s slowly getting worse. This may or may not be related but it’s odd to come on so suddenly. One day she could see fine and now it’s getting worse. 

Lastly, she also says that she has to drink close to 200-250 oz of water every day because if she doesn’t she gets hot flashes and is on the verge of passing out. 

What other tests should we get done? Could it be an autoimmune disease?

In your medical opinion, how bad was this burn. How long do you believe this IV could have been running interstitial prior to it being noticed?

This was bad. I'm not surprised there was chaos when it was discovered. TPN is considered a vesicant, meaning that if it infiltrates and goes into the tissues, it can cause severe tissue damage exactly as I see in your photos. In adults, I've never seen it given peripherally, only in a central line due to the risk. With that damage right at the joint, I would not be surprised if this was causing mobility issues but I think that'd be for a doctor to evaluate. 

I can't comment on how long it was running because I don't know the common rates for babies. I also can't comment on how quickly this would be visible with a baby's skin (I'd guess quickly though since there's less tissue). 

How was this addressed at time of discovery? What treatment did they do? What did they explain to you?

I'd want to know what their policies are on administering/monitoring these kinds of infusions and if there is documentation of assessments.

Edit - can you post a Pic of what it looks like now? Honestly I'm questioning if this should have been surgically cleaned for better healing. Maybe someone better versed in wound care can answer.",43,0,

544,Post,1cerk5t,Random dark brown spotting/bleeding + more odd symptoms  ,user34566543,Layperson/not verified as healthcare professional,1714258896.0,"
Hi Reddit docs! 

I’m going to try to keep this as brief as possible. 

I (F21) went on birth control (Loryna) back in September of 2023 to help with period flow and cramping. The first few months were awesome. I had no side effects, my periods were much better, and they came and went in about 6ish days.

February of this year I came down with a nasty flu and went on a full course of Tamiflu as I caught it early. As I was sick I noticed some dark brown spotting, but I blew it off as my bodies response to being ill. 

Since then, I’ve had an on and off spotting problem. Randomly it seems, I will spot / discharge dark brown blood. Sometimes it’s brighter in nature but typically it’s dark. My period ends, then a few days later, it’s back to spotting off and on, then it kind of tapers off. 


At first, I was extremely worried I had some to rectovaginal fistula because of the color of the discharge. 

Obviously I still don’t know why this is even happening, but I don’t think I’m having any symptoms of one and I haven’t had any surgery, sexual intercourse, or childbirths ever. 

The discharge doesn’t seem to smell like feces, more metallic like blood but also a little sharp (if that makes any sense). It seems kinda sticky like normal discharge is.

I am not sure if I should still be worried in case because sometimes I notice it after a bowel movement but also sometimes I notice it with no bowel movement- so I guess it doesn’t really matter? Not sure! 

I did have a yeast infection back in Feb/March but that was about it. 

Any insight is greatly appreciated. Thank you.

546,Post,1cer02m,Got some diabetes symptoms but blood work results are weird,ElegantState57,Layperson/not verified as healthcare professional,1714257364.0,"Fasting glucose **101** mg/dl (previous one was 99, and the one before that was 100 mg/dl). Fasting period was 10.5h.

2h glucose tolerance test... **68** mg/dl (!)

**BMI 20.5, 30M, Polish.**

Other blood tests that are off:

LYM 3.72, ref. range 1.10-3.30

LYM% 57.6, ref. range 14.1-45.8

NEU 1.71, ref. range 2.00-7.00

NEU% 26.5, ref. range 40-80

This was 12 days after having started to take euthyrox (50ug/day) since I scored around ~6 for TSH back in February.

Other morphology test are fine.

Any ideas? I thought the weird tingling, sometimes pulsations of sort on hands/fingers/feet, sometimes slightly needle-like pain on hands, or unusual pain deep inside my feet after hiking in the mountains, despite no signs of damage on the surface were symptoms of (pre)diabetes now I'm not sure what to think. I encountered this pain deep inside my feet for the first time in **February this year**, I'll admit I don't walk much (I go everywhere by bike) and apart from occasional running, push ups, pull ups and dumb bell exercices I largely lead a sedentary lifestyle, but this pain was so surprising it didn't feel like having sore feet, but as if something was seriously off. 

The needle-like in my hands I'm not sure when it started, could be more than a year or two, it only happens if I'm running, I barely noticed it at all and assumed it was related to sweating. I also had issues with **my feet getting hot for a good couple of years now**, it felt like I was overheating, but it never resulted in pain in my feet, so I simply avoided running when it's hot, and I don't run long distances anyway (usually 5-6 km, rarely 11-12 km). I don't really feel any tingling now but me feet are kind of sensitive, and so are my hands if I use a lot of force. Not to the point of being unwilling to bear it, but it's been like that the past 2 months or so and I really wouldn't like if it were to become worse, to the point of being unable to walk or run.

The endocrinologist suggested that it could be something neurological. I was also at an ophthalmologist and some lower (?) eye vessel(s?) were found to be narrowed but eye pressure was normal (12 and 14), I was asked if other family members had glaucoma (don't recall anyone having it), and was told to go for checkups once a year. I do recall having some slight blurs in the past now that I think about it but they were disappearing after a slight rubbing move near the eyelid, I always assume it was related to still being sleepy (I'm not a morning person).

I'll be seeing my family doctor next week, but I'm looking for extra ideas/opinions, my guess as a layperson is it could be a confluence of several things:

hypothyroidism - my thyroid was always on and off, better or worse, this time I think I'll have to keep taking euthyrox for life, could having elevated TSH levels for too long two long damaged my cardiovascular system by that much?

pancreas - something could be off here, I think my irregular sleep cycle, years of eating late and largely a sedentary lifestyle did some damage here. I foolishly assume reasonably fit (weight never exceeding 73 kg at 180 cm, not the worst time at running for someone who does it once in a fortnight, alright with push ups (65 in one go) and pull ups (16 in one go) was enough, well, yeah maybe not necessarily, I'm starting to think that like with BMI for some ethnicities/groups of people the 25 number can still be too high (some extreme outliers excepted), *some people are meant to be more active*. I used to be as a child, now as an adult I do the bare minimum, probably not enough for me.

cardiovascular - same as above

So I had to drive whit the a wedding in Hillsboro.. it’s in butt fucking no where… no signal .. no gps. Bermuda Triangle shit. 

So I drop her off and go free style garage sailing. ⛵️ 

I see this one farmhouse that has a garage sale sign 🪧 garage door open and tables with stuff in em.  No other customers just me. 

I pull in and go in the garage and begin to browse. I saw a couple knives and shit I liked but no prices…. Also no one manning the sale. Just me in a garage full of no priced items.  I looked at all the stuff and waiting a couple mins for anyone to emerge from an opened door leading into the house at the other side of the garage. Alas, no one came. So I declare .. “ALLO ! You having a garage sale ? No answer. So I go over to the open door and there is an old man sitting at a table in my direct line of sight and appeared to be reading some sheets of paper.. no distress and appeared in good spirits this is where it gets really odd. 

I say again.. now directly to him.. basically with just the table separating us. “You having a garage sale ? 

Nothing .. no response. But not like he was ignoring me. But like I wasn’t even actually there.. like I was a ghost just observing him. 

I thought… maybe he’s deaf so I knock on the door hoping he’d pick up on the wood vibration. Nothing… no typical human reflex of a stranger making noise and asking questions in your direction… 

I even crouched down to get my eyes on his exact level and waved my hands at him. 

Not ONE ounce of acknowledgment…. He wasn’t ignoring me.. I wasn’t there to him. His behavior was organic and he just kept messing with the papers.

I don't know how much details I should provide so I'll try my best to decribe the situation. 

We took my grandma to ER last Sunday (April 14th) because she was losing balance, had trouble moving her left arm and was talking a bit non concisely. Doctor checked her blood pressure which was high, gave her a pill and sent her home. 

We went again the next day since her sympotms got worse and her entire arm stopped functioning. Her blood pressure was 200/110 and they diagnozed her with having a mild stroke and kept her in hospital. 

Fast foward a bit, she was reciving IV, was getting better, moving her arm a bit etc. so they released her from a hospital on Wednesday (24th) and sent her to a rehabilitation facility to continue receving her therapy and also get exercises which were supposed to make her arm a bit better.

We went to visit her today and she seems worse than she was when she was first admitted to hospital 2 weeks ago. She cant communicate almost at all, arm is worse than it was on Wednesday when we last saw her and her eyes arent moving left and right properly. 

Now I don't know should we keep bothering the doctors there because they say everything is fine but hospitals are overcrowded here and with free healthcare you really get what you pay for and the last time they checked on her was yesterday morning. Is it normal for symptoms to come back like this after having a stroke? Should we be worried, is this normal to happen or is she supposed to keep getting better without these episodes? 

I would realy appreciate advice on this since we are really worried for her. Thank you in advance",2,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1cek8hm/is_it_normal_for_stroke_symptoms_to_come_back/

She has had what doctors said was sciatica for years. We found out Monday she has a tumor in her colon and lesions on her liver. She ALWAYS went to the doctor. And tried many things for her back pain… And she was doing what we thought was “good” for her age. She was sharp, super independent, and go around no problem. Her only issue was her back (which we suspect was this tumor the whole time). 

What gets me is she declined quickly in the care of the hospital. She became unresponsive shortly after the biopsy.They started morphene and Ativan.  They are now putting her on hospice.  Before she declined, they didn’t try to feed her or anything. I wonder if she got so weak not eating in two days plus the stress caused her to go downhill?

 I’m just sad, confused, and wish my mom would have told me what was going on while she still was responsive. I get that she won’t have to suffer, but I wish she had the chance to see us while she was still awake. 

I dont have access to any of her medical information and my mom doesn’t seem to know what’s going on. Is it normal for elderly to decline quickly in the hospital? Do doctors help guide terminal patients towards death since they know nothing else can be done? 

I’m sorry this is a long post but if you had seen this woman, you would never believe she was 93. It was an extreme shock to learn that she had extensive cancer. ",1,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1ceoykv/do_hospitals_help_guide_elderly_towards_death/

It sounds like your grandma is very very ill. Unfortunately, at her age, patients tend to decline very rapidly. There was likely a conversation regarding next steps after they found the tumor and lesions, including proceeding with comfort care measures. Once these are enacted, patients are often given plenty of morphine and Ativan to take away the pain and anxiety. In this sense, patients are not necessarily guided towards death, but allowed to die comfortable and with dignity.",5,0,
564,Comment,1ceoykv,Do hospitals help guide elderly towards death? ,orthostatic_htn,Physician | Top Contributor,2024-04-27 22:00:46,"Sometimes it helps to reframe things. Your grandmother is elderly, and was seemingly doing well. However, it sounds like she has actually been sick for a while, with what sounds like colon cancer with metastasis to the liver. This is a late diagnosis for something like this, so it's probably been progressing for a while. It feels very sudden to you and your family, but in reality the only sudden thing is that she went to the hospital and got the diagnosis recently.

Someone would have made the decision to go towards hospice treatment - likely your mom or someone else who was appointed to make decisions for your grandmother after she was no longer responsive. Hospice at this point is a very reasonable decision, as the treatment she would need for a probable colon cancer would be extensive and painful with no guarantee of success. At least in the US health care system, this is a decision made by families, with guidance from medical teams. If she's on hospice, there's likely a hospice nurse or social worker that you can talk to to get a little more information about what they're doing for her now.",4,0,

So today after work I ate and decided to take a nap. I was dreaming about having this weird vibrating sensation in my stomach, right below my breast bone. In my dream I checked my heart rate and it was around 280 and I started freaking out. I woke up and I think i still felt that vibration. I checked my HR and my BP and it was normal , around 70ish BPM and 115/70 BP. Since Im not too sure if I truly felt these vibrations or I was hazy, can someone explain what that could be if I felt the correct thing. 
I noticed that I have some periods in my life where when I wake up (sometimes) I feel like Im vibrating. Its not constant or frequent, I noticed it happens more when my axiety flares up. 
I Googled these “vibrating” symptoms and it told me I had MS or Parkinsons😩
A week ago I went to the ER because I had flashes of lights in my visual field and they lasered my retina and advised me to see a neurologist and to check my neck veins with an ultrasound just to be sure.  Ever since that I have had some anxiety about having a MS diagnosis. 
Mind you, I had a full cardio work up last month and everything came back normal. 
Im a 26F with hypothyroidsm, Hashimotos and anxiety.

Was hospitalized last week for 5 days last week because my CK levels were 70,000 - 80,000 
(Non-traumatic rhabdomyolysis). No Kidney or heart damage thankfully, but there were signs of liver damage at the time.

My personal symptoms before being hospitalized: extreme fatigue, tingling in arms/legs, extreme pain from my hips to my knees only, bright red blood in my stool and black urine (definitely not the norm) 

I went to my PCD for a check up yesterday and received a CMP test & a CK test. Since a lot of doctors seemed fascinated by their findings and still have no idea what could have caused my elevated CK levels yet, I thought why not post on Reddit to hopefully help someone in the future.

My results as of yesterday (over a week from hospitalization): 


Creatine Kinase: 968 U/L (Normal Range: 30-223 UL)




CMP Test Results:

Sodium Serum/Plasma: 138 mmol/L

Potassium Serum/Plasma: 4.0 mmol/L

Chloride Serum/Plasma: 104 mmol/L

Carbon Dioxide: 24 mmol/L

Anion Gap: 10 mmol/L

Glucose Serum/Plasma: 86 mg/dL

Blood Urea Nitrogen: 20 mg/dL

Creatine Serum/Plasma 0.73 mg/dL

Estimated GFR: Value >90 mL/min/1.73 ""square meters""

Calcium Serum/Plasma: 9.9 mg/dL

Bilirubin Total: 0.4 mg/dL

Alkaline Phosphatase Total: 65 U/L

Alanine Aminotransferase: Value 350 U/L

Aspartate Aminotransferase: 248 U/L

Protein Total Serum/Plasma: 7.9 g/dL

Albumin: 4.7 g/dL

I’m amazed and so incredibly grateful that my kidneys were completely fine, and that my levels seem to be normalizing again.

579,Post,1cen7j0,34 F - fever of unknown origin for 7 weeks+ - medically complex!,rskrrxx,Layperson/not verified as healthcare professional,1714247365.0,"Apologies for the amount of info I'm about to give here. Quite medically complex and none of my own doctors can figure out what's wrong so want to make sure I have everything down. 

Currently diagnosed;
Polyarteritis nodosa 
Stills disease
Adrenal insufficiency due to long term steroid use
Asthma 
Psoriasis
Fibromyalgia 
Embedded UTI
Bronchiectasis 
POTS

So late last year I started with very severe nausea and vomiting. I ended up with a hospitalisation and had a CT scan to rule out lymphoma (due to a slightly swollen lymph node and weight loss of around 15kg without trying). Scan was clean. 

Then 7 weeks ago I started with a fever, and since then it hasn't stopped. I did initially feel like I had stuff on my chest that I couldn't fully bring up, but that only lasted for a few days and isn't uncommon as a smoker with asthma (I know, I know). 

Now, usually fevers would alert me outside of obvious viral symptoms to my autoimmune stuff, but I don't have ANY other symptoms besides the fevers and my CRP and ESR are normal. I do however have lymphocytosis (very elevated).

Originally my fevers would be relatively normal throughout the day then spike late afternoon / early evening, but for the last couple of weeks I have a (recorded) fever 24/7. Still getting as high as 39 (degrees Celsius). I find my fever goes up whenever I'm moving around, but even after rest for half an hour it remains high. 

I'm currently waiting to see infectious disease but that's not until may 30th and if there's any testing advised before I would be grateful for advice to ask my GP (as by the time that appt comes round it'll be 10 weeks+ and there's no sign of this slowing down at all). My fatigue is obviously way way worse, and general aches and pains are much worse. But besides fever & feeling generally unwell with that, the nausea is still a present issue but I'm managing that as best I can with ondanestron currently, I have zero other symptoms that aren't beyond my normal scope of issues.

Hello everyone so I've been dealing with acne since I was 14 and I've had an emotional roller coaster journey with a full of ups and downs. Now I'm 18 and I'm still suffering with acne and it's to the point where I feel really self-conscious and I'm tired of my skin feeling like this. I've seen a dermatologist and all they do is look at my skin and give me a bunch of products that won't even work for me. I've also seen an esthetician and got a facial and my skin felt good but then after a couple weeks, my skin went back to being bad.
I've been on tretinoin for three months now and I felt like that has worked. I've also been on doxycycline, but stopped using it because I don't have another refill. I seriously need help and advice on what to do and what products to use!

My left foot also had the same problem before but it went away on its own with no traces left. There was also another one just slightly above my left leg’s ankle however it is mostly gone but you can still see the spot slightly as well as feel small bumps. I’ve picked before and it’d only get a bit worse but most of the times, scratching. Sometimes, the itch can get slightly intense. I’ve had times where i scratched the spot until i bled. I was taken to a doctor before however, I wasn’t prescribed any medications. I’d really appreciate in any helps with identifying this skin-related problem.

History of roux en y gastric bypass and full bladder removal. I had Type 2 diabetes before my surgery and now it’s resolved with diet and exercise plus major weight loss, of course. 
I take nexium, Zoloft 40mg, Lamictal 50 mg, Buspar 10 mg twice a day, and occasional Flexeril for muscle spasms and 1x weekly marijuana use. Might have a glass of wine a month. 

Lately I’ve had weird symptoms. It took me a lot of time and thought to even piece it all together. The first thing I noticed was lightheaded feelings and fatigue. Heavy feeling in legs. This went on for awhile and I just kind of ignored it. Then I started having urinary symptoms - a little incontinence, mostly feeling urgency or feeling like I had to pee but couldn’t. I also have heart palpitations here and there. I just thought that was anxiety. I also have a lot of weird diarrhea and constipation that alternates, but that’s been going on for years. 
Then yesterday I was driving and felt that weird tired lightheaded feeling and my vision was blurry. I pulled over and figured it would pass but for 10 minutes or so, it persisted and I noticed double vision. I went to urgent care and they did an EKG and tested my sugar- it was 240- which is weird. They also sent me to the ER. I did not want to go but they were concerned about the blurry/double vision, so I went. They did another EKG and gave me a heart monitor to wear for 2 weeks. They also did orthostatic vitals. I didn’t notice a big difference between positions and my blood pressure. 
I just cannot fathom what could be going on here. It’s so many different bodily systems. I feel like I am just a crazy woman and a hypochondriac (my parents always gaslighted me when I was sick so I question myself) but these symptoms are real. I didn’t even put it all together until yesterday honestly. ",1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1cej0ny/weird_symptoms_that_feel_unrelated_so_puzzled/

Weight 248, height 6’2” with a history of major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder with obsessive thinking traits. I’m currently being treated by a psychiatrist. Otherwise, I’m in good physical health. I’m currently taking the following meds:
-Trintellix 20mg/day
-Gabapentin 1,200mg/day
-Compazine 15mg/day
-Klonopin 3.5mg/day (slowly titrating off)

I’ve been in a depressive episode for several months. After 4 weeks on 10mg of Trintellix, my doctor increased the dose to 20mg and by week 3, my depression/anxiety symptoms were noticeably improving but not fully resolved yet. 
I then came down with a bad viral infection with a fever (102.5), bad cough, fatigue, etc. During this time, my depression symptoms returned. It’s been 10 days since I got sick and I’m still recovering and have a lot of fatigue. My psychiatrist thinks my depression symptoms are being worsened by the sickness and she expects me to recover once I’m better. 
However, I wanted to ask here also. Can the flu or other illness worsen depression symptoms, especially since I was starting to feel better but not in remission yet? And can it take some time to fully bounce back?

I’m Wondering if it’s worth it to seek out a weight loss doctor.

21F, 187lbs, 5’4

Elderberry immunity vitamin, 2 ankle and joint supplements, black seed oil pills

daily Zyrtec for allergies, prescription xyzal, nuvaring, and Ritalin LA and IR for ADHD

occasional drinker (maybe 2 drinks once or twice a month)

Non smoker 

I’ve struggled with my weight most my life and always been a few lbs heavier than folks but I am genuinely starting to put on a noticeable amount of fat and it’s concerning to me. I stay as active as I can and walk everywhere on my campus and hit the gym for weights a few times a week. But every time I start to lose some weight I lose about 10lbs and then I either get sick or injured.

Literally no joke. The last 4 years in a row I’ve tried to lose weight this has happed at least twice each year. I have chronic ankle pain from lots of previous injuries as a dancer. I’m sick of the cycle and I’m tired of seeing myself creeping towards obesity (family has obesity related health problems and I rly don’t want that for myself) so I’m seriously considering seeing a weight loss doctor to get prescribed GLP-1’s or whatever they recommend.

Any insight helps a bunch. Thank you!

EDIT to add: I do wonder if maybe I have such a hard time controlling my diet because of my ADHD. After I got diagnosed in December I realized I was 100% dopamine seeking with food my whole life. I’m literally always thinking about food or what’s my next meal. I can’t stay in a calorie deficit to save my life, even a small one because my brain tells me that I literally need to taste and eat whatever it is I want. It’s so hard to resist. 

When I take my adhd medication it kind of suppresses my appetite and the constant food thoughts go away. when I take an instant release it’s completely gone and it’s nice to not always think about food. Im wondering if I should just ask my PCP if she can swap me to vyvanse instead since I know it also treats binge eating.

No sleep disorders aside from mild sleep apnea that is treated with a CPap-events down to 0. No anemia, mono, or autoimmune disorders. Normal thyroid function and blood counts. 

For a year I have had severe excessive sleepiness that we are trying to find a reason for. I also have speech issues that started a while back-at first only once every now and then, now it’s multiple times every single day. Stuttering, using wrong words like “cup” instead of “cuff”, losing memory of what I was saying, sometimes losing ability to speak, and word repetition. 

Last night I thought I was having a stroke or that I needed to go to the ER. I was chatting with my husband on our way home about a car accident in town. When I said “hit” I couldn’t stop. I started saying it over and over and over. I physically couldn’t stop. That turned into only being able to make a “h” sound. Over and over again. Then I couldn’t speak at all. I was blowing air out from my throat with no noise. I couldn’t say a single thing no matter how hard I tried-& this was still an uncontrollable repetition of trying to say something but saying nothing. Finally I got the ability to make sounds back and as I was trying to say I couldn’t speak I just  started saying a “c” sound repeatedly. Then my tongue couldn’t move. It started feeling way too big for my mouth (it wasn’t swollen. It’s like I was just way to aware of it’s presence.), and I was then trying to say speak. I had so much spit flying everywhere. I felt like I was fading away. Like I was going to pass out but without any typical passing out feelings. That’s the best I can describe the weird way I felt anyways. I snapped out of it shortly after. 

My husband said this lasted 45-50 seconds. It felt like an eternity. It’s never ever been that bad. Three weeks ago I had a spell where I lost ability to speak and memory of what I was saying, but that was maybe 15 seconds and then I was ok. Nothing like this. Nothing like my daily issues.

Hi guys, just to note Ive never had a pneumothorax or any real lung issues. 3-4 weeks ago I had a very sharp pain in my chest that lasted for 10 minutes, which I believed to be the harmless “precordial catch” but the following weeks I had spikes of pain up to 15-20 times a day in my chest, shoulders, neck and occasionally, my left arm. The pain could be worse when I’d breathe in. I began to worry about either pneumothorax or a clot as I’m young and relatively slim.

I went to the hospital on Wednesday to get it checked. I had blood tests, 3 ECGs, a chest X-ray and a lung ultrasound and everything came back great. They noted that I had high Blood pressure but didn’t worry as I was extremely anxious and on nicotine pouches.

From my X-ray the doctor was concerned that I had a pneumothorax but it turned out just to be a skin fold showing up that I’ve had for years now. I’m still in pain now and I’m extremely stressed, even though the doctors said there’s no doubt that I’m clear and can go on my flight next Sunday. 

I’m wondering if it’s just muscle pain or some sort of chest Infection, since leaving the hospital I’ve had a  sore throat with white patches on my tonsils if that’s any help. Thank you!

I do smoke weed, mostly vape pens, since surgery I have only used 2 carts.

  


**Explanation of perforation story:**

I have a right ear perforation, had it for 10 years because it was just really tiny, probably caused by the many ear tubes I got put in, but the doctors were mistaken as they never worked for my issue, so my parents took me to an ENT and fixed my adenoids, I wasn't able to breath properly, just exhaling through my nose vigorously every time id breath. Felt like I was sick with congestion for years.

After going to the ENT he checked my ears bc I told him about the tubes and checked my ear and saw the perforation, which he told me to try and let it heal on its own, and here we are 10 years later. (I would go every 6 months, then covid happened so I didn't see him from 2020 until late 2023)  
I have had not many issues regarding my perforation besides getting water in it after diving and having my ear plugs fall out, I was dizzy and in pain for days, gladly had no issues once subsided.

Late 2023 I finally got an appointment, nothing has gotten better over time, so the best option he gave me was a tympanoplasty, he explained to me very well about the entire thing and I was ok with having a surgery again since it was 10 years since my last, was just sick of having tubes put in for no reason, which is why I have some trust issues with doctors when having to go under anesthesia, I used to freak out when I was a kid every time.

I took the tympanoplasty in February, I am an adult now so the trust issues I had with doctors is mostly subsided, but I still have my nervous thoughts come to me, but nothing more than that. I put my full trust into my ENT because I knew he was able to fix my issue I had before, so that is why I was so confident in taking the surgery.

When I woke up the doctor said that the surgery was a success and that I was able to go home now, so I did after grabbing some burgers (not sure if I should have, I wasn't restricted from eating foods, so I would presume it would be ok, but it hurt a lot to even eat)

  
I took antibacterial drops for 7 days and saw my ENT on the 11th day, which he said all looked good and removed excess packing he put in, and I was good to continue using the drops until the bottle was empty he said.

12th night/13th day I had a choking incident that was unexplainable, and still have no clue what happened, but I was watching a film at a friends house, all of a sudden I felt something come from my ear down to my throat, I almost got it out before choking on it but I was not quick enough, so I immediately walked home in the rain. I had whatever this was stuck in my throat for a good hour, it didn't completely block my airways, but I could not talk easily until it went down on the way to the hospital.

I got X rays the next day, which never had anything show up, so its still a mystery as to what happened that day. Even my ENT had no idea what could possibly have happened

After that I started getting headaches in April, which I originally got the surgery in late February, so I brushed it off as unrelated, since it was mild and very on and off. 

My appt in April I did a hearing test first, starting with the pressure test, which tickled so I did not think much of it, and I breezed over the audible tests too, nervously knowing that my hearing was not good at all, since leading up to the appt I started losing my hearing again and having clicking, but the issue was that did not happen at home until after that appointment.

  
My test results on the hearing test were completely flipped from the before procedure tests, so my high pitches were good before but now I could not hear them well, and opposite for low pitches. My ENT said that he never saw that before and he quickly noted that unexplainable stuff happens all the time in the field, so I understood that. 

My ENT looked in my ear and saw my graft was still in place perfectly, but closer inspection and apparently I got a fungal infection. As of writing, I just finished my ear drops which I did for 10 days.

My hearing has gone back to what it felt like during march after my 1st week, but I still cant hear better than before the surgery itself.





*If you cant answer some that's ok. I should probably ask my ENT for further inspection to see if the infection is truly gone, so then I may get a good answer to some of these after that.* 

**Issues + Questions:**

- Clicking and popping, even after the eardrops.

- I do get clicking in both ears, but the pop sounds are really loud on my right ear

- I still have a fullness to my ear

- I never got any blood or discharge ever from my ear, other than wax being cleaned out with the drops. should I be concerned? 

- If you have any theories of what happened with my choking fit, I would love answers. My ear hurt like hell after that happened. 

- Can this fungus spread?

- Would the fungus be related to my flipped pitch test results from April? if not what could cause something like this?

- Yawning hurts and causes immense popping

- I got a taste of the drops I took on 2 occasions, is that normal? Would that mean my eustachian tubes are working correctly? So any kind of fluid would come right through? (just incase the infection could have caused pus or discharge buildup behind the ear. Bc that would mean I would need to go for more ear tubes)

- Would my ENT be able to see into my middle ear if there is nothing happening in front of the ear drum?

- Laying down I can feel stuff moving in my ear, every side I try and it moves. It doesn't happen a lot, but happened a few times already. 

- (probably a question for my ENT next visit id presume) Can I shower without earplugs? guessing not due to not having a clear indication on if the fungus is gone or not

- Would I be allowed to use a headset? If not when could I? Would bone conduction headphones by Shokz be any better? I don't own any ear buds that go into the canal, so would these other options be safe?

- Are loud sounds something I should stay away from? For reference I work in a deli with deep fryers that beep loudly and the ventilation is really loud. To me now they aren't as loud bc usually I can only hear out of 1 ear at work when I first come in

- If my pitches in hearing swapped and now the low pitches are easy for me to hear, would that mean I could theoretically fix my high pitch hearing again? Why has it not already done so after this fungal infection?

- lemme know if there is anything I should not do related to my issues, just incase it can make things worse

I've been undergoing some physical occurrences. Started on March 28th, which I would describe as a painful gas bubble sensation. It started in my upper back and chest. Lasted for about two hours. I was fine for the rest of the day. It came back on March 29th. This time, the pain were in my back, chest and both sides of the rib cage. It lasted for 45 minutes.

From April 1st to April 5th: had an unusual amount of gas/bloating, burping, occasional regurgitation and nausea. On April 5th: I began to vomit. Vomited throughout the day. I thought it was acid reflux. But I've never had acid reflux for that long. A typical case was a few hours. 

On April 8th: I had gone to an urgent care clinic. I needed to be treated and a doctor's letter. I was given an EKG, which was fine. I was given a breath test for H. Pylori and it wasn't detected. I was diagnosed with functional dyspepsia and was prescribed with a 30-day amount of famotidine. I started to take the famotidine on April 13th. The treating physician also recommended for me to see a gastroentrologist. 

So far (as of April 25th), I haven't had an acid reflux flare-up (no bloating, nausea, vomiting, gas). But I am still getting the ""painful gas bubble"" sensation in my ribs, back and chest. It isn't predictable and it doesn't last long. Also, I have a sensation of something stuck in my sternum area. Occasionally, it feels like a ""tugging"" sensation if I move around. 

I know that I should go to my primary physician. Trust me, I've been trying. Can't get an appointment as soon as possible. I also need for my doctor to sign off for the authorization to see a GI specialist. 

I am tempted to go my local hospital's Emergency Department, pay the daggone $150 deductible and be treated there.",3,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1ce47tq/experiencing_physical_symptoms_and_i_dont_know/

Hi, first I'm just gonna get some of this out of the way (at the very bottom is a comprehensive list of all symptoms, medications/anything I've taken for it, diets, holistic approaches, family history, and tests/labs I have had done as well as a final sort of conclusion and sidenotes. I will also include the nearest approximation for the dates that I can remember, please bear with me):  
  
Age: 20, Male, 140lbs, White, USA, Nothing Diagnosed, No current meds/doses, drug use is edibles for chronic pain management, non-smoker, started March 2023.  
  
(I have had bloodwork done multiple times, with no significance, though if you think it might be helpful to know something, please ask as I have so much and it would take a while to list it all out)  
  
This is probably going to be a long one, but there is so much that I need to preface this with. Last year, I was 19 years old, healthy, agile, and slightly athletic, but then around March of last year, I began to get hit by upper abdominal discomfort. I saw a gastroenterologist, and was told it was most likely Celiac (from the second that I stepped foot in his office and told him I was in pain), so I did bloodwork which ruled it in, and had then an endoscopy that came back inconclusive and was just told to try a gluten free diet for a few months (and that if it didn't help, then I could go back to a normal diet). Since then, I have been prescribed so many different medications to try and I myself have tried so many OTC and holistic approaches as well. Around July 2023, the pain had gotten so bad that I was basically doing nothing and already stopped working my part-time job because of it.  
  
August 1st, 2023 I went to the ER for the first time, and was just given an IV with some fluids and nausea medication, which did not make any change at all. I also had an ultrasound there that came back entirely fine and in the clear. Since then, the pain has increased tenfold, and is all in my upper abdomen, and it feels like it is directly near where my gallbladder is. They also did an ultrasound, but nothing came from it.  
  
For added context, not a single medication, vitamin, holistic approach, anything that I have ever done or taken has helped the pain except edibles. The edibles don't take away the pain, but they make it easier to tolerate and somewhat ignore, which is more than literally anything.  
  
Since then, I have gone back to college for my sophomore year, and I've literally just been toughing this out while waiting for doctors appointments, all of which led nowhere. I then was scheduled for a HIDA scan in November, which came back with my gallbladder's ejection fracture being around 86%. After drinking an Ensure Plus drink from them during the HIDA scan, I was practically doubled over in pain, even more so than I am currently, and was basically curled up in a ball in my Dad's car. I was told by the doctor that it was one of the best functioning gallbladder's they'd ever seen, and that it was definitely not the issue (though I was hesitant because of doing my own research about biliary hyperkinesia).  
  
I also began speaking to a nutritionist near the beginning of the year, as I was told that it could be something with my diet or such. I'd say that my diet was okay, not great, but I've improved it since then, whilst my symptoms have worsened. She wanted to immediately get me tested for SIBO, which I did and ensured that I followed all prep instructions and test instructions perfectly. It came back negative, which she was surprised at, and then began throwing some things at the wall to see what would stick. I ditched her because she was really dead-set on SIBO  
  
Around the beginning of 2024, I went to see a new gastroenterologist for a second opinion. She believed that I was constipated (which I was), so I was told to take some Miralax and modify my diet to increase my fiber intake, which I did, and have been doing fine since then. For reference as well, my urine is usually a clear yellowish color, which raised no alarms. After fixing the constipation and still being in the extreme pain, she ordered an ultrasound, which I went for in February 2024. It came back showing that I had a 4mm polyp, but it was deemed to be insignificant. She sent me for bloodwork, which came back fine. She wanted to do another endoscopy, in order to entirely rule out Celiac. I had the endoscopy, and it came back negative for Celiac, which was quite a relief and she noted that she did see an increase in acid reflux. After the endoscopy, I had zero pain for the next hour or two, probably because of the anesthesia still in my system.  
  
I have seen her once more since the endoscopy so far, and she seems to be at quite a loss of what it could be. She told me to try holistic doctors, she recommended a consultation with a general surgeon, as well as a cardiologist, as one of my symptoms of having this pain is shortness of breath (which is widely noticeable, as walking more than a few feet leaves me practically panting.  
  
Here I am now today, where I just got out of the ER for the second time after nearly seven hours. I went because the pain got so bad today, and last night, I had cold sweats, felt clammy, had chills. After this, I had realized that I was just pushing the cold sweats aside when I was not inside of my bedroom, and it has actually probably going on for the past few weeks. I currently do not have any clamminess or chills, but would not be surprised if I did when I went to bed tonight. For reference, I keep my room quite cold because it makes me sleep and feel so much better.  
  
The ER then did some bloodwork, as well as took a urine sample. Both of which came back fine, and then I was sent to get an ultrasound there as well. Nothing showed, and I made sure to tell them multiple times before about the 4mm polyp, which was my main and literally only lead on what could be wrong with me, and was told that it was still the same size. The ultrasound tech also told me that a 4mm polyp would likely not cause any pain at all.  
  
After the ultrasound in the ER, they sent me back to give me something in my IV to help with the pain. They gave me 1000mg of some pain medication (I missed the name, though I was told it was basically better Advil). I thought that they had missed something and not even hooked it up correctly, but there was ZERO change in the pain at all, and they then asked me if I wanted to do a CT scan, which I more than happily did. Absolutely nothing. Nothing alarming at all came from it, and from a medical standpoint, that is the absolute ideal outcome. To me, I so badly just want to find out what is wrong with me. I just got home tonight and popped two edibles just to deal the pain, but it's not a long term solution because firstly I don't want it to be, and secondly because I literally can't afford to sustain this for an extended period of time.  
  
It does not matter if I eat or not in the day, as the pain will still be there no matter what, usually with eating making it slightly worsen for the rest of the day. Now that most of the medical stuff is out of the way (except the comprehensive list), I wanted to also slightly rant about how badly it is affecting me academically and socially.  
  
I'm currently in college, as mentioned before, and I try to hang out with my friends as much as I can. I always try my best to be the most positive and upbeat person in the room, but honestly it's so fucking hard for me to stay composed at this point. I feel as if I'm reaching a physical breaking point because of how helpless and useless anything I try and do feels.  
  
I have been so fucked over academically by this; I have already failed one class last semester because I missed so many classes and material that I bombed the final. I am currently re-taking that course, and am trying to do better in it, but it's so hard; I literally need to psych myself to do homework or even just sit in class. I currently am taking 4 courses, (one of which was the re-take) another of which, I am currently failing because I have missed so many classes, had so many flare-ups during exams and normal class time that I feel like my absolute hardest only gets a me a failing grade. My very first semester, I ended up with a pretty good GPA for myself, around 3.5 (but it was my first and probably easiest semester). My second semester, this pain did not affect me as much because it started to really ramp up after finals had already ended, though it was still a battle every day to do something. One of the most gut-wrenching and fucking destroying things to me is that I can't even get any accommodations from the college because I am not diagnosed with anything at all.  
  
As soon as I hear back from my professors, as I missed both of my courses today because I was in the ER, I want to sit down with the two that are in the classes I'm struggling in (they are both writing intensive and math courses, and it takes such a big toll on me). I really want to talk person-to-person with them to just explain my situation and see if they would help me with any accommodations regarding the final exam. If they can't, I'm literally going to fail both of them, and lose thousands of dollars because of it. I've literally started considering putting higher education on hold because of this pain, though I've thought long and hard about it, and I don't think I could genuinely deal with the social consequences of literally being there alone without any of my friends (most of them are graduating quite soon).  
  
The other scariest thing is I'm so fucking scared that I won't be able to work because of this pain; my bank account is currently starved, though my parents do support me an extremely large amount and I could never thank them enough for being my family.  
  
Out of all of this, there was two single days. Two days that I had zero discomfort and zero pain at all, as if somebody just waved a magic wand around. These days were not back-to-back, and there has not been a good day in a long time. The first one was in early September, and the other was in early November. Both of which, I was so up to par that I hiked 8 miles each day; the next day in which, the pain had returned as if it had never left. Thank you for listening and reading if you made it this far, and I already thank you even if you don't leave a comment or have any advice. Thank you.  
  
Here begin the lists...  
  
List of all prescribed medications:  
  
At one point, I was taking nearly all of these, and began to ween myself off of them into lower doses, eventually entirely cutting them out in Late August 2023, as I personally felt that I was overmedicated and it actually made my stomach feel so much worse (which it did).  
  
Dicyclomine 10mg, 2 capsules every 6hrs as needed (Around May 31 2023 - Late August 2023)  
  
Omeprazole 20mg, once daily (Around May 31 2023 - Mid. July 2023)  
  
Upped to 40mg, once daily (Around Mid. July 2023 - Early August 2023)  
  
Upped to twice daily (Early August 2023 - Late August 2023)  
  
Sucralfate 1gm, before meals (Around Mid. July 2023 - Late August 2023)  
  
Famotidine 40mg, at bed (Around Mid. July 2023 - Late August 2023)  
  
The following are all 20mg, twice daily (afaik). Note that these were not taken concurrently, and only after I had stopped the other. These are prescribed by my second, and current GI doctor.  
  
Pantoprazole (Around February 2024)  
  
Esomeprazole (Around March 2024)  
  
Lansoprazole (Around Late March 2024)  
  
Amitriptyline, 10mg at bed (Around Late March 2024)  
  
List of all OTC medications (I apologize, I do not have dates for these):  
  
Miralax (GI Recommended it)  
  
Pepcid (GI Recommended it)  
  
Phazyme Ultimate Strength  
  
Gas X  
  
Mylanta  
  
Ibuprofen  
  
Alka-Seltzer  
  
List of all diets/food restrictions I've tried/done (None of which made me feel any better):  
  
Gluten Free (Approx. 4 months)  
  
Low Fodmap diet (No approx. date)  
  
No dairy (I rarely even have dairy; the most being on an occasional burger  
  
No processed foods (Still ongoing; I can't even stomach more than a full meal anyways)  
  
No/Lower sugary foods (Still ongoing; same reasoning as the no processed foods)  
  
Low fat diet (Tried for two weeks; is quite difficult living on a college campus)  
  
Short SIBO diet (2 days, Bland chicken breasts with rice) (Made me feel horrible)  
  
List of all tests/labs I have had done:  
  
Multiple different bloodwork labs (Across multiple dates between May 31 2023 and today) (Only ruled in Celiac disease)  
  
Abdominal Ultrasound (1st ER Visit, August 1, 2023) (Insignificant)  
  
Upper Endoscopy (Mid. June 2023) (Insignificant)  
  
HIDA Scan (Early November 2023) (Insignificant, EF: 86%)  
  
Abdominal Ultrasound (Mid February 2024) (4mm polyp detected in gallbladder)  
  
Upper Endoscopy (March 22, 2024) (Entirely ruled out celiac disease)  
  
Abdominal Ultrasound (April 6 2024) (Insignificant)  
  
CT Scan (April 6 2024) (Insignificant)  
  
List of symptoms:  
  
Upper Abdominal Pain 24/7/365 (Since Mid. March 2023) (Worsened around August and has been continually)  
  
The following are a result of the pain:  
  
Extreme shortness of breath  
  
Nausea (I believe it's associated with the pain and is also 24/7/365)  
  
Loss of appetite (Though I have miraculously stayed around the same weight)  
  
Occasional dizziness  
  
Brain fog (I first thought I just had short-term memory issues, but then I saw that this is a common side effect of what I'm currently going through, and it genuinely shows; I quite literally forget what I'm talking to somebody about and then I'm too awkward to ask them to repeat something that they have seen I heard quite clearly and paid attention. I think this is one of the biggest things that is harming me academically.)  
  
The following are more recent developments, and I don't have an exact/precise start date:  
  
Cold sweats, both at night while trying to sleep and while in some non-climate controlled environments  
  
More extreme brain fog  
  
More extreme shortness of breath  
  
Slight dizziness  
  
Higher temper/more easily frustrated  
  
HOLISTIC THINGS IVE TRIED (Probably not all of them, but I don't remember):  
  
Baking Soda + Water  
  
Ginger Water  
  
100% Pure Peppermint Tea  
  
Notable Family/Medical History:  
  
A few years ago, probably around 2018, I went to a pediatric gastroenterologist because I was 16, and was diagnosed with abdominal migraines, given sumatriptan, and put on my merry way. I did not take the sumatriptan frequently, as I think I was doing the nasal spray a little bit off and the taste was horrible. This pain eventually went away, and was definitely not as severe as this.  
  
When I was a baby, I had surgery for pyloric stenosis.  
  
Here's some family history, but forgive me, as I don't know it all:  
  
My mother's side has a horrible history with bad gallbladders and them needing to suffer before it was agreed to be taken out.  
  
My mother's side also has a history of aortic aneurysms.  
  
My father's side has a history of cancer, with my grandfather passing away in 2012 from brain cancer, and then my uncle passed recently from Stage 4 Bile Duct cancer.  
  
My father's side has a history of cardiac issues and such (and my father had open heart surgery nearly a year ago).  
  
Sidenotes:  
  
Upcoming planned visits:  
  
Being consulted by a general surgeon May 20, 2024.  
  
Still looking for a cardiologist  
  
Also looking for holistic doctors now  
  
(Maybe trying chiropractor??? idk)  
  
Literally nobody knows about how much I've been through except my family members. I never let a single ounce of any of this show because I already get sympathy from family members, and I don't know if I can also take it from friends too (though I am extremely thankful for the sympathy from my family)  
  
Another side note is that I also think that I may have used to have hourglass syndrome, as I remember sucking in my stomach for practically all of high school (though I was literally like 130lbs). Since then, I believe that I've stopped doing that, and actively avoid doing it. (I actually learned about this doing some research in Reddit and jumped when I heard about this, but went to sit down and realized that I stopped doing it at some point.)  
  
I also wanted to include that I am not currently sexually active, I'm a non-drinker, non-smoker, and have no allergies and am currently covered under really good insurance from my father.  
  
Conclusion:  
  
If you wish to read my other posts and plethora of comments, they are in my account history, and it might have a few small details I acquitted from here, most of which are related to my ""very fun"" Celiac journey. They also have my Celiac bloodwork from both times.  
  
I have no mental health or mental illness history, and I currently am not under any extreme stress or anxiety because I handle it extremely well, though I fear that I may be developing health anxiety after the CT scan and ultrasound at the ER came back normal.  
  
I literally thank you so much if you've read this far. Any input or questions are greatly, greatly appreciated, and I hope whoever is doing this is doing good for themselves :) (P.S. Thanks for reading a 3000+ word reddit post that I somehow drafted and wrote in an hour)  
  
Some humor that I have managed to get out of this if anyone cares:

At triage, the nurse asked me why I hadn't come sooner if it's been going since March 2023)

Around 3 months ago I started to have random vomiting episodes every month with occasional  nauseousness, with abdominal pain and hot flushes/sweating. Which I now know could have been food poisoning from multiple meals that had prawns and chicken in.

Around 2 months ago I developed severe abdominal pain worse than what I was having before and specifically  on the right side of my stomach and was admitted to A&E with ? Appendicitis. Abdominal ultrasound was inconclusive as they couldn’t see my appendix due to excess gas/ the position wasn’t clear but they could see a small amount of free fluid which they said could be normal for a young female but the doctors requested a CT to rule out burst appendix. The CT came back normal and so were the bloods that were requested, after a few days I was discharged as my symptoms slightly improved and the pain was put down to kind of a normal thing that ‘happens occasionally in young women’ with no explanation. I was originally happy with this given that there clearly wasn’t anything acute going on. 2 months later and my symptoms have been on and off but with new concerning symptoms. Some days I’m completely fine and other days I wake up with the pain or it’s just constant cramping similar to period pain sometimes it’s burning in nature/ just a general discomfort as in my stomach feels tight. Additionally I get really bad lower back pain with the stomach cramps. I’ve noticed lying on my back makes the pain worse but being on my side when in bed helps. Other symptoms include increase in bowel sounds, bloating, increase in flatulence, increase frequency of bowel motion per day, burping, generally feeling tired. The lower back pain seems to be the worst as nothing seems to relieve it other than when I have certain days where I am randomly symptom free with no abdo pain. I have no bloody stools and passing urine as normal. The vomiting episodes have stopped. 

Other information to note I used to regularly take ibuprofen for chronic pain that at the time I was being investigated for Lupus but again nothing really came about this as it was during the Covid pandemic and my symptoms eventually resolved. 

In terms of what I’ve done to help, I’ve taken peppermint oil tablets that can sometimes help but sometimes makes me worse. I have tried buscapan but doesn’t have any affect. I’ve tried mindfulness to see if it’s stress related. From what I’ve read food poisoning could have triggered IBS but would this cause lower back pain? Or could my ongoing symptoms be completely unrelated. Any advice on what I can do to help and/or any suggestions as to what these symptoms could be (without scaring me lol).",0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1ce1a3x/gastro_docs_please_help/
